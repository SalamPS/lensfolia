# African Eggplant

## Description

African eggplant, Solanum aethiopicum , is a deciduous shrub in the family Solanaceae which is grown for its edible fruits which are cooked and eaten as a vegetable. African eggplant is a highly branching plant which can grow up to 2 m (6.6 ft) in height. The leaves of the plant are arranged alternately on the stems and have smooth or lobed margins. Leaf blades may reach up to 30 cm (11.8 in) in length and 21 cm (8.3 in) in width. The leaf petioles are oval or elliptical in shape, reaching up to 11 cm (4.3 in) in length. Plants produce clusters of up to 12 white flowers which develop into egg or spindle-shaped berries which are red to orange in color with a smooth or grooved surface depending on variety. African eggplant may also be referred to as scarlet eggplant, bitter tomato, mock tomato, garden egg or Ethiopian nightshade and is native to Africa, likely resulting from the domestication of a related species, S. anguivi .

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Solanum aethiopicum

Common Name: african scarlet eggplant,bitter tomato (En); aubergine amère, aubergine africaine, aubergine écarlate, tomate amère, djakattou (Fr); 非洲紅茄 (Cn); nakati etíope, berenjena escarlata (Sp).

## Uses & Benefits

African eggplant is grown primarily for its bitter orange-red fruit, which may be eaten boiled, steamed, pickled or in stews with meat and other vegetables. Young leaves are also often used in soups.

African eggplants are a source of fiber, potassium, and offer traces of beta- carotene, ascorbic acid, iron, and calcium.

## Varieties of African Eggplant

African eggplants, scientifically known as Solanum aethiopicum, vary in color and shape based on the cultivar. The species is divided into four main groups: Gilo, Shum, Kumba, and Aculeatum. Each group has unique characteristics:

Gilo : Edible fruits that vary from spherical to oval shapes. Kumba : Has a primary stem with edible leaves and fruits, which can be green or red. Shum : A short plant with small, smooth leaves. Its shoots are edible, but its small fruits are bitter and less preferred. Aculeatum : Recognized for its flat fruits, often grown for ornamental use.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Growth requirements for African eggplant vary with variety. All types grow best in full sun and well-draining, deep soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8. Gilo types grow best at daytime temperatures between 25 and 35°C (77 and 95°F). Kumba types can grow in hotter temperatures of up to 45°C in low humidity, whereas Shum types require warm and humid conditions in order to thrive. No varieties of African eggplant tolerate very cold or water-logged conditions.

### Growing from Seed

African eggplant seeds can be collected from fully ripe fruits. Once the seeds have been extracted, they should be laid out on a piece of paper to dry in a place where they are not exposed to direct sunlight. Once dry, seeds can be stored for many years and still remain viable. Seeds should be planted in a prepared nursery bed and should be sown 15 cm (6 in) apart with a further 20 cm (8 in) between rows. Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they reach 15 to 20 cm (6–8 in) in height and have 5–7 leaves. Plants should be hardened prior to transplanting by gradually reducing the amount of water they receive. Plants should be spaced 50 cm (20 in) apart allowing 75 cm (30 in) between rows.

### General Care and Maintenance

African eggplants will benefit from frequent irrigation during the dry season, particularly when fruiting, to ensure high yields. The crop should be weeded as required to prevent competition. Addition of fertilizer in the form of cattle or chicken or cattle manure or compost will improve yields.

### Harvesting

African eggplant is typically ready for harvest 100 to 120 days after planting. The fruit should be harvested before the skin changes color from white to pale yellow when the skin becomes tough. Fruits should be harvested regularly to encourage maximum fruit production. Young leaves may be harvested from 45-60 days of growth.


# Alfalfa

## Description

Alfalfa, Medicago sativa , is an herbaceous perennial in the plant family Fabaceae (peas and beans) which is primarily grown as a forage crop which can be grazed by animals or harvested as hay to be used as an animal feed. Alfalfa has a deeply penetrating taproot and the stems of the plant branch from a woody base, growing upright and erect or along the ground. The leaves of the plant are made up of three individual leaflets (trifoliate) which are are narrow and oval or oblong in shape with a smooth upper surface and slightly hairy lower surface. Alfalfa plants produce flowers on racemes (flower stalks) and each raceme possesses 10–35 densely packed purple flowers. Alfalfa produces spirally coiled seed pods each containing 2–6 seeds. Pods may have a smooth or hairy outer surface. Alfalfa plants can reach a height of 120 cm (47 in) and live for between 3 and 8 years. Alfalfa is also commonly referred to as lucerne and is believed to have originated in Caucasus area, north-western Iran and north-eastern Turkey.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Medicago sativa

Common Name: lucerne, purple medic (En); alfalfa, mielga (Sp); luzerne (Fr); luzerna (Pt); अल्फाल्फा (Hi).

## Uses & Benefits

Alfalfa leaves are edible and can be eaten as a leafy vegetable. Alfalfa is used primarily as forage for animals and is cut and stored as hay or silage. As a legume, the plant fixes nitrogen so can be used to increase nitrogen in the soil and is a commonly used cover crop. Alfafa is a good source of vitamins, calcium, iron, phosphorus and potassium.

Besides its use as feed, alfalfa has been traditionally used as a medicinal herb for humans. Its seeds and dried leaves can be consumed as supplements, or sprouted as edible alfalfa sprouts.

## Varieties of Alfalfa

Farmers growing alfalfa should consider the following factors when selecting varieties to plant:

Purpose : Decide why you're growing alfalfa. If it's for making hay, focus on varieties that can withstand time and yield a lot. If it's for grazing, pick types that can grow back quickly after grazing.

Dormancy & Winterhardiness : Check the dormancy rating of the variety you want to plant. Ratings range from 1 (very dormant) to 10 (not dormant). In places with warm winters and little frost, go for varieties with ratings of 9 or 10.

Disease and Pest Resistance : Choose varieties that can at least moderately resist common diseases like bacterial wilt, fusarium wilt, phytophthora root rot, verticillium wilt, and anthracnose.

Forage Yield : It's a good idea to see if a variety has performed well in your specific region before deciding to plant it. This helps ensure a good yield.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Alfalfa is adapted to grow in a wide variety of environments but it requires careful management. Alfalfa grows best in deep, fertile, well-draining soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Alfalfa has a long taproot and quickly depletes nutrients from the soil. If grown in a soil that is poor in nutrients, the crop may require the addition of copious amounts of fertilizer. The vigorous root system means that alfalfa can tolerate dry periods and still give a good yield.

### Seeding

Soil should be well prepared before planting alfalfa seeds. A firm seedbed is recommended to improve the stand by improving seed contact with the soil. This helps seeds retain moisture and prevents new roots from drying out. The soil can be firmed before planting by using a roller. The seedbed should also be free of weeds and kept moist.

Alfalfa crop has tiny seeds and it's crucial to plant them at the right depth.The optimal planting depth varies depending on the type of soil. On medium and heavy soil, plant the seed 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) to 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) deep, while on sandy soil, plant it 1/2 to 1 inch deep. If there's enough moisture, you can plant the seed shallower, but if the soil is dry, you should plant it deeper. While sowing, cover the seeds with soil that is moist enough to promote germination, but not so much that the shoots can't break through the surface.

### General Care and Maintenance

The alfalfa stand should be kept free from weeds. The easiest way to achieve this when the crop is being grown on a commercial scale is with the use of a pre-plant herbicide. There are several of these product available for use on alfalfa. Fertilizer should be applied in accordance with soil test results. Lime, phosphorus and potash are the most important nutrients for a healthy alfalfa stand.

### Harvest

Alfalfa is harvested at different times depending on it's intended use. Alfalfa which is cut between thee late bud and early bloom stage generally gives acceptable yields of high quality feed without reducing the quality of the stand. In contrast, repeated harvest of alfalfa which is till in the vegetative stage of growth leads to a reduced stand. In the first year, alfalfa can generally be harvested twice without any detrimental effect on winter survival; once in summer prior to the flowers emerging, and once later in the year with the date depending on location. Alfalfa is usually harvested by combine and baled as hay or cut for direct feeding to animals.

# Almond

## Description

The almond tree, Prunus dulcis, is a deciduous tree in the family Rosaceae that is grown for its edible seeds (nuts). The tree has brown or gray bark and either an erect or weeping growth habit, depending on the variety. The trunk can reach 30 cm (12 in) in diameter.

Almond leaves are 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) long with a serrated edge and grow alternately on the branches. The tree produces white to pale pink flowers and hairy green fruits that are oblong in shape. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed. The seed is protected by a hard brown shell.

At maturity, the flesh of the fruit becomes leathery and splits to reveal the nut inside. Nuts generally measure 3.5 to 6 cm (1.4–2.4 in) in length. Almond trees can reach heights between 4 and 10 m (13 and 33 ft) and have a commercial lifespan of between 30 and 40 years.

Almond may be referred to by variety and this includes bitter almond. Almond nuts are generally long and may also be referred to as sweet or bitter almonds, depending on the variety. They originate from wild species found in Central and Southwest Asia.

### Crop Details

Scientific name: Prunus dulcis Other Common Names: Almendras (Spanish), amandes (French), mandorle (Italian), Mandeln (German), badaam (Indian), لوز (lawz in Arabic) 杏仁 (xìngrén in Mandarin Chinese) and アーモンド (āmondo in Japanese)

## Uses & Benefits

The almond nut is eaten raw or processed into butter, flour, extract, oil, paste, syrup, and milk.

Almond oil is used as a flavoring agent in baked goods, perfumery and medicines. Sweet almond oil is used for cosmetic creams and lotions.

The hard shells of almonds can serve various functions, such as abrasives and sustainable materials.

## Propagation

### Basic requirements

Almond grows best in Mediterranean climates with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The optimal temperature for their growth is between 15 and 30°C (60–85°F) and the tree buds have a chilling requirement of between 300 and 600 hours below 7.2°C (45°F) to break dormancy. Almond trees will grow best when planted in deep, well-draining loam, although they can withstand drought and grow in poor soils. The trees benefit from being planted in areas sheltered from frost and wind, as trees bloom early and can therefore be susceptible to damage from late frosts. Trees will generally bear nuts after 3 to 4 years, with the nut crop developing after blossoming in the fall.

### Propagation

Almond trees are most commonly propagated by budding. Dormant wood is collected in winter, when the trees are dormant and stored until spring. T-budding is usually carried out in spring and involves joining a bud from one variety to the rootstock of another. The bud is taken from a parent with desirable characteristics and grows to produce a new tree. Trees may also be propagated by grafting. Cuttings are taken from trees during dormancy and grafted to a suitable rootstock in the spring.

### Planting

Once trees have been acquired from a nursery, it is important to plant them as soon as possible and keep the roots moist in the meantime. Almond trees should be planted by digging a hole just deep enough to accommodate the root ball. The tree should be planted by carefully backfilling the hole around the tree after it has been properly positioned. The planting depth should not exceed the height of the graft union. The soil around the newly planted tree should then be tamped and watered deeply but not excessively. If planting multiple trees, then they should be spaced in rows 6–7 m (20–23 ft) apart, with 5–6 m (16–23 ft) between each tree.

### Pruning

Almond trees should be pruned in the first year and every subsequent year to help thin the canopy and prevent disease. The first pruning is critical to establishing the canopy shape. Three limbs should be selected to form the basis of the tree's canopy and all others removed, including any growth below the lowest limb. In the second year, two scaffolds (lateral branches that grow to form a Y with the primary limbs) should be selected and the rest removed. Aim for the remaining scaffolds to be evenly spaced around the canopy.

General care and maintenance

Almond trees will benefit from a layer of mulch around the base to prevent the growth of weeds and conserve soil moisture. Mulch should be spread around the tree in a 1 m (3 ft) radius. Leave a gap between the mulch and the trunk to prevent it from rotting. In addition, an application of fertilizer should be made once in the spring before any new growth and again in the fall.

### Harvesting

Almonds are typically harvested in the dry season, usually between August and October. The process begins with shaking the almond trees using mechanical tree shakers or hitting them with a pole, causing the mature almonds to fall to the ground. Once on the orchard floor, the fallen almonds are then collected and put in storage bins or trailers, which will later be transported for processing.

# Aloe Vera

## Description

Aloe vera is an herbaceous perennial in the family Liliaceae grown for its succulent leaves which have a variety of culinary and medicinal uses. The plant grows best in full sunshine and requires little water for its establishment, growth and reproduction. It prefers areas with mean annual temperatures within the range 19-27°C, but can tolerate temperatures ranging from 10°C to 35°C.

The Aloe vera plant has a short, stout stem and a rosette of fleshy, lanceolate leaves which have a serrated margin of small white teeth. The leaves may be flecked with white and are pale green or grey-green in colour. Aloe vera plants produce a conspicuous inflorescence composed of densely packed pendulous yellow flowers on a spike which can be up to 90 cm (35 in) in height. The plant itself can grow to be 1 m (3 ft) in height, it takes 4-5 years to mature and can live for up to 100 years if well cared for.

Aloe vera is indigenous to Eastern and Southern Africa. It belongs to a large class of plants known as “xeroids” characterised for its ability to close its stomata completely to avoid loss of water. This adaptation allows plants to survive long and extreme drought periods.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f.

Common Name: true aloe (En); aloès officinal, aloès vrai, aloès vulgaire (Fr); lu hui (Cn); sabila, sávila (Sp).

## Uses & Benefits

Aloe vera plants are grown for medicinal value including improving digestion and boosting the immune system. They are also grown for extraction of the gel inside the leaves. The gel is used in desserts, yoghourts and beverages. The gel is also commonly used as a home remedy for treatment of burns and to prevent constipation. It is also used as a skin and hair nourisher.

The plant contains vitamins A (beta-carotene), C and E, which are antioxidants. It also contains vitamin B12 and folic acid.

## Varieties of Aloe Vera

The Aloe genus includes over 500 plant species. Aloe plants are divided into three rough groups: tree aloes, shrub aloes and stem-less aloes. The groups can be differentiated through leaf colour, toothing, shape, as well as plant height and flowering style.

Some species are grown as ornamentals for their attractive architectural leaves and colourful flowers. Zebra aloe ( Aloe saponaria ) variety is characterized by its distinctive white stripes or spots on the leaves. Arabian aloe ( A. rubroviolacea ) has long blue-green leaves with red teeth and is planted outdoors in warm climates; the leaves turn red if exposed to full sun. Aloe barbadensis miller is known for its thick and fleshy leaves that contain a high concentration of gel and is valued for its medicinal properties.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Aloe vera grows best in full sunshine and requires little water for its establishment, growth and reproduction. It prefers areas with mean annual temperatures within the range 19-27°C, but can tolerate temperatures ranging from 10°C to 35°C. It is adapted to areas with mean annual rainfall in the range 700 mm to 3000 mm. During the winter months in the subtropics, the plant becomes dormant and utilizes very little moisture.The pH of the soil should range from 6 to 7.5, and it should be fertile and well-drained.

### Growing from Seed

Aloe Vera can be grown from seeds, but is most easily propagated from suckers which are readily produced by the mother plant. The suckers are commonly referred to as “pups”. The pups should be cut from the main root by gently uprooting the mother plant and finding the point of attachment. The young plant should be cut from the parent using a sharp knife. Pups can be safely removed when they have several sets of leaves. The young plants should be planted in their own pot and watered deeply. Refrain from overwatering to force the growth of new roots. If multiple plants are being planted, provide them with individual pots or plant at least 60 cm (24 in) apart outdoors.

When planting using seeds, aim at a spacing of 3ft by 3ft. Spacing is extremely important for high quality harvest. A typical Aloe Vera plant has 25 leaves which extend up to full length of between one foot and 2 feet. This is why experts recommend a minimum spacing of 3 feet all round. Planting the seeds in organic matter-rich, well-drained soil is recommended.

### General Care and Maintenance

Aloe plants are generally very easy to care for but care should be taken to avoid overwatering. The plants should be watered deeply but allowed to dry out before the next watering. Check the soil prior to watering. Allow the soil to dry down to a depth of 7.5 to 10 cm (3-4 in) for older, well-established plants or 3.5-5 cm (1-2 in) for younger plants. In addition, although Aloe plants require lots of light, sitting them in full sun can be harmful and it is best to position potted Aloes in a bright window. If the plant is receiving too much sun, the leaves will begin to turn brown. Aloe vera can tolerate moderate wind conditions, but excessive wind can damage the leaves and lead to dehydration. Balanced organic or slow-release fertilizers rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium can be applied during the growing stage to support healthy growth.

### Harvesting

Aloe plants are usually harvested 4 times per year. The crop takes some 18 to 24 months to mature. Ideally, you should take around three leaves per plant. That comes to a total of 12 leaves per plant every year (keep in mind that only older outer leaves are harvested). You can expect an annual harvest of 60,000 kilograms of Aloe Vera per acre per year.

# Amaranth

## Description

Amaranth is the name given to a group of approximately 70 species of annual or short-lived perennial plants in the genus Amaranthus including several species of aggressive edible weeds native to the US such as Amaranthus retroflexus (redroot pigweed). Amaranths are branching broad-leaved plants with egg-shaped or rhombic leaves which may be smooth or covered in tiny hairs. The leaves have prominent veins, can be green or red in color and have long petioles. The plants produce single flowers on terminal spikes which are typically red to purple in color. Amaranths can reach up to 2.5 m (6.6 ft) in height and are usually grown as annuals, harvested after one growing season. Amaranth may also be referred to as Chinese spinach and their origin is unclear due to their worldwide distribution.

Amaranth leaves and stems are commonly eaten after cooking in a manner similar to spinach. There are four main species which are cultivated as vegetables; A. cruentus, A. blitum, A. dubius, and A. tricolor. Several species, such as A. caudentis, A. cruentis and A. hypochondriacus are grown as a grain crop in places such as Mexico, Nepal and India and are used to produce cereals and snacks. The leaves are cooked alone or combined with other vegetables. The seeds are grounded into flour or cooked into porridge.

The leaves are rich in manganese, calcium, iron, vitamins A, B and C while the seeds are rich in beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols.

## Varieties of Amaranth

Of all the indigenous tropical leafy vegetables, amaranth has the largest number of species and varieties. The choice of variety varies widely among regions and is dictated largely by the species available. Regardless of species, the choice of variety is influenced by individual preference for leaf color and taste. To identify which varieties are best adapted to your location, compare during different growing seasons the yield potential of currently grown varieties with that of other available varieties.

A. tricolor : Amaranthus tricolor is a first growing herbaceous plant of 30–125 cm height. This variety comes in various leaf colors such as dark green, red, scarlet, maroon, purple, yellow, and cream. A. blitum : It grows between 10 and 80 cm tall, sometimes reaching 90 cm. The leaves are green or more or less purple in color and matures 4 weeks after sowing. A. dubius : It grows up to 150 cm in height. This variety can be green or tinged purple. The flower clusters are in spikes on side branches and these can be branched. Harvesting may be done 3-4 weeks after sowing. A. hybridus : The stems are thick and often ribbed or tinged with red. The leaf and stem surfaces have small fine hairs.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Amaranth grows from sea level to 2400 m altitude. The different species may suit different altitudes. Normally the hotter it is the better it grows and it generally thrives within a temperature range of 22-30°C. A minimum temperature of 15-17°C is needed for seed germination. Amaranth is grown during both wet and dry seasons, though irrigation is normally required for dry season crops since the rate of transpiration by the leaves is fairly high. Frequent application of water is required, related to the stage of growth of the crop and the moisture-retaining capacity of the soil. It can however tolerate periods of drought after the plant has become established. It is adapted to low to medium humidity.

Amaranth grows best in loam or silty-loam soils with good water-holding capacity, but it can grow on a wide range of soil types and soil moisture levels. Amaranth can tolerate a soil pH from 4.5 to 8.

### Growing from Seed

Amaranths are propagated from seed and can be planted either by transplanting or direct seeding. Certified seeds with special attributes, such as tolerance/resistance to pest and diseases and high yielding should be used. Indirect seeding, seeds are either broadcasted or sown in rows at 0.5 to 1.0 g per m2 of bed. Since Amaranth seeds are very small, seeds are mixed with sand at a ratio of 1g seed to 100g sand for easy sowing and uniform stand. Farmers can instead choose to mix 1 part of amaranth seeds to 4 parts of chicken manure or ash.

Seeds should be sown to a depth of 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) in rows spaced 50 cm (20 in) apart and covered with a very light layer of soil. When the seeds germinate allow them to grow for one week. before thinning the plants to keep 20 cm (8 in) spacing from each other.

### General Care and Maintenance

Amaranth is easy to care for and requires little maintenance. While the seedlings are young, it is important to remove any weeds from around the plants to prevent competition. Applying a layer of mulch will help to prevent weeds and conserve soil moisture. The plants will benefit from supplemental irrigation during dry periods and the addition of fertilizer once or twice throughout the growing season.160 kg/acre of NPK 10–10–20 is recommended. The crop should be top dressed to promote better re-growth with CAN at monthly intervals. 15 days after transplanting, apply N at 20kg/acre as top-dressing.

### Harvesting

Amaranth leaves are harvested by thinning and clipping. During thinning, the whole plant is uprooted. Thinning starts 2-3 weeks after germination or when the plant has 6-8 fully grown leaves. Leaves can also be clipped at regular intervals. Clipping may starts 3-4 weeks after germination. The tender leaves are clipped once a week until the onset of flowering. Frequent harvest prolongs the harvest period and delays onset of flowering.

Grain amaranth varieties are usually ready to harvest after about three months. The flowers can simply be cut from the plant using a pair of scissors and set in a warm, dry place to finish drying out. When the flowers are dry, seeds can be removed by brushing or by beating the flowers in a bag. Passing the beaten flowers through a fine screen mesh can help to remove the seeds from the chaff.

# Anise

## Description

Anise is an annual herbaceous plant in the Umbelliferae family that is primarily grown for its fruits, which are used as a spice.

The plant has alternately arranged leaves and a grooved stalk. The petioles on the lower leaves can range in length from 4 to 10 cm (1.6 to 3.9 in), and they are rounded with a serrated edge. As the plant grows taller, the upper leaves get increasingly shorter and feathery.

The aniseed plant produces umbels of white flowers as well as an oval, hairy fruit with one seed that is flattened and hairy. An annual plant, anise has a height range of 45 to 60 cm (17.7 to 23.6 in) and only has one growing season. Anise may also be referred to as aniseed and originates from the Mediterranean

### Crop Details

Scientific name: Pimpinella anisum

## Uses & Benefits

Aniseed is widely used to flavor pastries; it is the characteristic ingredient of a German bread called anisbrod, Aniseed is also widely used in meat and vegetables throughout the Mediterranean and Asia. It is widely used as an herbal tea and has been used medicinally since ancient times. Absinthe, anisette, and Pernod liqueurs are flavored with the essential oil.

The leaves are used as an alcohol flavour in drinks like raki. Salads can also contain leaves

## Preserving and Storing Anise

Drying: Dry anise seeds on trays of paper for several warm days outdoors. After drying, pasteurize the seeds in the oven at 100°F for 15 minutes.

Storing: Store leaves and seeds in an airtight container.

## Propagation

Basic prerequisites Temperatures between 6 and 24°C (42.8-75.2°F) and 12 to 18°C (53.6-64.4°F) are ideal for anise growth in temperate and subtropical climates. Frost won't be tolerated by the plants.

Anise can be grown successfully in a range of soil types, although it thrives best in soils with a pH of 5.0 to 8.0. The plants grow poorly in sandy or heavy clay-based soils and thrive best in well-draining loam.

Since they are sensitive to transplanting, seedlings grow best when planted directly outside. The seeds benefit from being soaked overnight before planting to speed up germination, and they should only be sown after all threat of frost has passed. Before planting the seeds, the planting area should be ready by tilling the soil to a fine tilth.

If multiple plants are being grown, allow 2.5-15 cm (1.0-6.0 in) between individuals within the row and a further 15-90 cm (6.0-35.4 in) between rows. The seeds should be sown between 1 and 3 cm (0.4-1.2 in) deep. Keep the seedbed moist as the seeds germinate by not letting the soil entirely dry out.

## Where to Plant Anise

Anise seeds should be planted in a sunny, wind-free location in the garden. Due to its thin stems, this herb may require staking if the wind picks up. Finding the ideal location in your garden for anise may need some trial and error because it is usually very sensitive to the hot sun and chilly northern winds.

For a sweet licorice aroma just feet from the kitchen, you may also grow anise in pots right outside your back door. Try planting anise alongside coriander in a colorful collection of pots with other herbs that have similar growing requirements.

## How and When to Plant Anise

The anise plant is sensitive to cold weather. Plant anise outdoors in warm climates with a long growing season after the final spring frost and after the soil has warmed up.

Anise seeds should be sown indoors in biodegradable pots eight weeks prior to transferring the seedlings outside once all threat of frost has gone in colder locations with a shorter growing season.

Anise seeds take a while to sprout. In actuality, it could take up to four weeks until the first seedlings poke their heads from the soil.

Anise seeds should be sown at a depth of 1/4 inch; germination takes 20 days or so.

Plant spacing should be between 6 and 18 inches. Plants should be spaced at least 18 inches apart once they are 6 weeks old.

Grow six anise plants for fresh leaves and cooking, and twelve for seeds and preservation.

Planting a companion anise

Companion planting: Anise is said to promote the growth of cilantro. Aphids and fleas are believed to be repelled by the strong scent of anise. Never grow anise near carrots or radishes. Grow creeping thyme beneath the foot of anise.

### Light.

Full sun is ideal for anise growth. Aim to place your anise plants where they will receive at least 6 hours of daily direct sunlight.

Water and Soil.

Plant anise in loamy, well-drained soil. Add several inches of compost to very heavy soil to give plants the light-textured soil they prefer. When the ground starts drying up, water anise, but do not overwater it.

### Fertilizing.

Around your anise plants, spread a layer of compost to help with fertilizer supply during the growing season. Around midsummer, you can also give your plants a dose of all-purpose fertilizer.

Harvesting of the seeds.

Cut the flower stalks and seed heads, then hang the stalks upside down in a warm, dry, shaded area. Wrap the seed heads in a paper bag so that the seeds will fall into the bag. Thresh the seeds after drying, or pasteurize them for 15 minutes in a 100°F oven. Before the first fall frost, finish the harvest.

# Apple

## Description

An apple is a deciduous tree grown for its fruits, known as apples. Apple fruits are one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the world. They are round (pome) in shape and range in color from green to red. The domestic apple tree is believed to have originated from Western Asia and the Mediterranean, having several wild ancestors. China is the largest producer of apples worldwide. Apple farming can be profitable and rewarding for farmers with suitable land, climate, and markets.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Malus domestica

Common Name: tufaha (Sw), apple tree (En), manzano (Sp), pommier (Fr)

## Uses & Benefits

Apples are most commonly eaten fresh but can also be used for baking and cooking. They can be processed into applesauce, cider, vinegar, juice, or butter. Slices can be dried for later consumption. Apples can also be used for the extraction of useful compounds such as fructose and pectin. Apples are rich in fiber, Vitamin C, minerals, and antioxidants.

Apples are a great source of soluble fiber, which can help reduce intestinal disorders. They also aid in controlling insulin levels by slowly releasing sugar into the bloodstream. Additionally, apples can lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of respiratory diseases. They are also known for their ability to detoxify and cleanse the body. Furthermore, apples have been traditionally used to treat conditions such as fever, dysentery, diarrhea, and constipation.

## Varieties of Apple

There are thousands of apple varieties available around the world, and each one has its own unique characteristics such as size, color, shape, flavor, texture, ripening time, storage life, and disease resistance. Apple varieties can be broadly classified into three categories: (1) cider varieties, (2) cooking varieties, and (3) dessert varieties. These categories differ in various aspects such as color, size, aroma, smoothness, crispness, and tang.

Some of the most commonly known apple varieties are Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Gala, Fuji, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Braeburn, McIntosh, Jonagold, and Pink Lady.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Apple trees grow best in the tropics and at higher latitudes. They require a mild growing season and a cold winter to break their dormancy. In these latitudes, the tree will flower in spring and the fruit will ripen in the fall. In the tropics, the leaves will remain on the tree longer, making it essentially evergreen, and flowering and fruiting will happen sporadically throughout the year unless the tree manages to enforce a uniform cycle across the entire tree by bending shoots to create a wide tree.

Apple trees require fertile, well-drained, and well-aerated loamy-sandy soil, with a slightly acidic to alkaline pH of 5.5-6.5. You must test your soil before planting and amend it with organic matter, lime, or sulfur if necessary. Apples require a lot of moisture during the flowering and fruiting stage. Therefore, if you are growing apples in hotter regions, you will need to irrigate your trees. However, keep in mind that excess water around the root zone will encourage disease outbreaks and result in low crop yield. The best method of irrigating apples is through drip irrigation.

### Growing from Seed

When planted from a seed, an apple tree can take six to ten years to mature and produce fruit of its own. Apple trees are small to medium-sized, reaching heights of 5–10 m (16.4–32.8 ft), with a central trunk that divides into several branches. The leaves of the tree are oval in shape and can reach up to 13 cm (5.1 in) in length and 7 cm (2.8 in) in width.

The standard method of propagating apple trees is by budding. When planting an apple nursery or orchard, it is highly advisable to plant seedlings budded from rootstock to prevent an increase in bud dormancy. Budded trees should be pruned in the first year to encourage new shoot growth.

Apple trees can also be propagated by grafting and mound layering. Grafting involves joining the lower part of one plant (rootstock) with the upper part (scion) of another. Grafting is usually done during the dormant season and must be performed on dormant scion and stock wood.

Mound layering is used to propagate apple clonal rootstocks. Soil is mounded around shoots that have been cut back, thereby stimulating roots to grow at the base of the shoots. A year before propagation begins, 8–10 mm (0.3–0.4 in) diameter stock plants are planted in rows and then cut back to 45–60 cm (17.7–23.6 in). They are then grown for one year.

In the spring, the plants are again cut back, this time to 2.5 cm (1 in) above the ground. New shoots gradually form, and more soil and bark are added in mounds around the plants. This cycle can continue throughout the growing season. Then the shoots are harvested by cutting close to the bases. The mother stool beds are then left exposed until further growth of the new shoots has occurred, and another cycle of hilling begins.

Apple seedlings are planted with a depth of 10-12 inches and spaced 8-10 feet apart in rows.

### General Care and Maintenance

In the tropics, apple trees require careful management to make heavy crop loads sustainable. This includes bending shoots, pruning the tips, and defoliating the trees. Flowers are also removed to promote growth until the first fruit production, generally after 2 years.

### Harvesting

An apple is ready for picking when its background skin color turns from green to yellow. The fruit comes off easily when harvested. Harvesting apples at the right time is key, not only to obtain the highest quality fruit but also to maximize the storage life.

Maturation time is dependent on weather conditions during the growing season. Early maturing apples are harvested in August-September.

There are several reasons why proper picking technique is important. First, simply pulling apples from the tree with force is likely to bruise the fruit and remove the stems. Apples without stems do not store as well as apples with stems.

Second, it is easy to identify apples that have been picked incorrectly. They will have noticeable fingerprint bruises. Make sure to palm instead of grab when picking. Yanking tends to remove spurs from the tree. These fruit spurs represent next year's crop, so by pulling them off, there will be fewer apples to harvest next year. In addition to not pulling the apples from the tree, there are some other actions that are important to avoid.

Apples that have touched the ground are a potential source of contamination. Never mix apples from the ground with picked apples. Apples that are decaying or rotten should be dropped on the ground and never placed in your bin. Do not throw or drop apples into your bucket, as this will certainly cause bruising. And always avoid squeezing the fruit when picking.

# Apricot

## Description

Apricot, Prunus armeniaca is a deciduous tree in the family Rosaceae grown for its edible fruit. The apricot tree has an erect growth habit and a spreading canopy. The leaves of the tree are ovate with a rounded base, pointed tip and serrated margin. The tree produces white to pink flowers, singly or in pairs, and a fleshy yellow to orange fruit. The apricot fruit is a drupe that appears similar to a peach with skin that can be smooth or covered in tiny hairs depending on the variety and a single seed enclosed within a protective outer shell (stone).

Apricot trees can reach 8–12 m (26–39 ft) and can live anywhere between 20 and 40 years depending on variety and growth conditions. Apricots may have as many as three centers of origin in China, Central Asia and the Near East with Turkey being the largest producer worldwide. In Africa, apricots are largely grown in South Africa.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Prunus armeniaca

Common Name: Armenian plum (En)

## Uses & Benefits

Apricots are low in fat but rich in vitamin A and beta-carotene. These nutrients act as antioxidants to protect your cells from damage.

Flavonoids, the antioxidant present in apricots, helps to protect against inflammation and inflammatory illnesses, along with reducing obesity, diabetes, and heart disease risk.

Apricots can be consumed fresh or dried. They may also be processed into jams and jellies, syrup or juice.

## Apricot Varieties

Choose varieties suited to local climates and soil conditions. Below are some of the common varieties grown widely.

Moorpark : Known for their sweet and rich flavor. They have a deep orange color and are often considered one of the best-tasting apricots.

Harglow : They are medium-sized, with a sweet and juicy flesh. They are a popular choice for fresh consumption and canning.

Tilton : These apricots are known for their intense apricot flavor. They are good for eating fresh and for making jams and preserves.

Goldrich : Apricots are medium to large in size and have a smooth, sweet taste. They are often used for drying or making apricot-based products.

Blenheim : Blenheim apricots are small to medium-sized and are known for their exceptional flavor. They are often used for making apricot preserves and are sometimes called "Royal" apricots.

Royal Rosa : The apricots have a sweet and slightly tart flavor. They are medium-sized with a pinkish blush on the skin.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Apricots have a high genetic variability and as a result, they also have a wide range of growing conditions. The trees tend to bloom early compared with other stone fruits and are therefore susceptible to damage from late frosts. Apricots have a chilling requirement (period of cold required to break dormancy) of between 250 and 1200 hours below 7°C (45°F) depending on the variety. Dry climate is good for fruit maturation.

Apricots will grow best in deep, well-draining soils rich in organic matter with a pH of 6 - 7 and will not tolerate water saturating.The Apricot tree will struggle if your soil is shallow, poor, or too heavy, to prevent this amend your soil with well-rotted organic material.

Trees should be watered regularly during the growing season to aid with fruit development. During dry periods, water trees every 10 to 14 days. Apply water deeply and widely, to at least the width of the canopy. Water at ground level to prevent diseases. Add mulch about 3 to 4 inches deep to conserve more water.

### Growing from Seed

Apricot trees are usually propagated vegetatively to maintain the desirable genetic characteristic of the parent. Trees can be propagated from cuttings or by budding and grafting.

Cuttings are lengths of stem ranging from 6-9 inches usually taken from the previous year's growth of an established tree. Cuttings are taken in late winter or early spring and rooted so that they produce a whole new tree. When selecting cuttings, choose a branch with three or four leaf buds and cut it at a 45-degree angle. Strip any leaves from the bottom half of the cutting, but leave the leaves on the top half. Keep the new cuttings moist so they stay healthy and strong until you can get them in the ground.

Budding and grafting involves joining two genetically distinct plants; one is used for the lower part called the rootstock and another is used for the upper part, known as the scion. The scion is attached by inserting a bud from the desired variety under the bark of the rootstock so that it produces a new tree. The selection of the rootstock variety is very important since it will affect the tree size, the resistance to soil-borne pathogens, and the drought and frost tolerance of the grafted tree.

Apricot trees should be planted in full sun. In colder regions it is beneficial to plant them close to a north facing wall which helps reduce the speed with which the trees warm in the spring, delaying bloom. Plant bare root trees in a pre-dug hole which is slightly wider than the root ball. Backfill the hole so that the tree is planted to its original planting depth. It is usually possible to identify this from changes in the color of the bark. If planting multiple trees, space them at least 7.6 m (25 ft) apart.

### General Care and Maintenance

Apricots should be pruned annually and are generally trained to an open center. Annual pruning encourages new fruit spurs. When pruning begin by removing any dying, dead, or diseased branches, as well as any new branches that are growing inwards to allow sun and air to reach all parts of the tree. Cut back leading branches to stimulate outwards growth and remove any branches that are crossing over or rubbing against each other, as well as any suckers and watersprouts.

When the tree is bearing fruit, it is important to thin the fruits to leave 3 or 4 per cluster. This allows fruits to become larger and prevents the tree from reducing production the following year.

Trees will also benefit from the application of a nitrogen fertilizer in Spring. Phosphorus is essential when the tree starts producing fruits to help in boosting fruit production.

### Harvesting

Apricots are ready for harvest when the fruits change from green to yellowish orange in color and feel slightly softened, but still firm to the touch. Pluck ripe fruits by cupping them in your hand and gently twisting to detach it from the stalk.

Store harvested fruits in a cool area free from damaging factors. The fruit is best stored in a single layer to minimize bruising which can lead to decay.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Armillaria root rot Armillaria mellea

- Symptoms: If tree is infected after it has reached 5 years of age then typical symptoms include poor terminal growth and small leaves; around midsummer the whole tree suddenly collapses; in orchards trees usually die in a circular pattern; infected trees often have a fan-shaped white fungal mat growing between the bark and wood of the crown.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus survives in dead roots; symptoms similar to Phytophthora root rot.

- Management: Management Once a tree is infected there is no treatment and it should be removed, fumigants do not control fungi in soil adequately; do not plant apricot in newly cleared forest or on the site of old orchards with a history of Armillaria.

#### Brown rot blossom Monolinia spp.

# Artichoke

## Description

Artichoke, scientifically known as Cynara scolymus, is a herbaceous perennial thistle cultivated for its edible fleshy flower head, commonly referred to as the "heart," which is considered a delicacy. The plant has arched, irregularly lobed leaves that are silvery green, reaching a length of 50–82 cm (19.7–32.3 in) and bearing a few spines. The buds grow up to 3-4 inches in diameter, have a rounded base, and taper to a tip or block shape. These buds are harvested at an immature stage before they open and reveal the flower.

The flower head itself measures 4–8 cm (1.6–3.1 in) in diameter and consists of numerous triangular scales and purple-colored individual florets. Artichokes take about 150 to 180 days to mature after sowing and can reach heights of 1.4–2 m (4.6–6.6 ft). Originating from Southern Europe and the Mediterranean.

Italy stands as the largest global producer of artichokes.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Cynara scolymus

Common Names: leaf artichoke, artichoke (En); artisjok( Dutch); artichaut (Fr); carciofo (Italian); alcachofra (Portuguese); alacachofa (Sp); al-kharsuf (Arabic)

## Uses & Benefits

Artichokes are primarily cultivated for consumption and can be enjoyed either raw in salads or cooked. They offer nutritional value, providing a significant source of folic acid, magnesium, iron, and potassium. Additionally, each artichoke contains less than 40 calories, about two grams of protein, and nine grams of carbohydrates.

Apart from consumption, artichokes can be canned, pickled, or processed to produce tea, liqueur, or extract secondary metabolites such as cynarin and chlorogenic acid for use in alcoholic beverage preparation. Due to their high antioxidant content, artichokes are considered a health food and have potential benefits in lowering cholesterol and regulating blood sugar levels.

## Varieties of Artichoke

There are several varieties of artichoke, some of which produce big buds with plenty of flesh, while others are more decorative. These are some of the varieties grown.

Green Globe Artichoke : The most common type with wide, deep green buds and a light purple tinge. Excellent for use in salads.

Imperial Star Artichoke : Produces 4-5 inches wide buds with a similar flavor to the green globe variety, albeit slightly sweeter.

Violetta Artichoke : Known for its thick purple leaves, this variety offers 5 inches long and 3 inches wide artichokes. It has a nutty, buttery flavor and is commonly used in salads.

Big Heart Artichoke : This variety features a large, fleshy base weighing around a pound, and it grows without thorns. The buds are dense and measure 3-5 and a 1/2 inches wide.

Baby Anzio Artichoke : The smallest variety, measuring just 2 inches in diameter. It is harvested early, resulting in a tasty bud with a sweet and nutty, caramel-like flavor.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Artichokes are cool-season crops and thrive in deep, fertile, and well-drained loam or loamy clay soils with a pH between 6.0 and 8.0. They require high environmental humidity levels and ample sunlight. It is essential to avoid planting artichokes in extreme heavy clay or light sandy soils. In cases where drainage is an issue, raised bed culture is recommended, as it leads to warmer soil temperatures in spring and faster establishment.

The optimal daytime temperature for artichokes is 20–22°C (68–71.6°F), with an ideal nighttime temperature of 12–14°C (53.6–57.2°F). While these plants can tolerate both cold and high temperatures, extreme conditions can reduce the tenderness of the flower heads. Frost, in particular, can cause blistering in the flower heads and may even kill the buds.

Artichokes can grow on slightly sloped fields, but such areas require frequent irrigation to ensure the development of high-quality flower heads. However, waterlogged soil should be avoided, as artichokes cannot tolerate excessive moisture.

Throughout the growing season, artichoke plants require frequent watering, which can be done either 1-3 times per week or once every 2-3 weeks. Adequate water supply during the flowering and bud formation stage is crucial for the formation of a satisfactory number of flower buds, resulting in higher yields.

### Growing from Seed

Artichokes are usually propagated vegetatively from underground shoots known as "ovoli" or from the suckers, stumps, or dried shoots from the previous growing season. Alternatively, they can be grown as annual plants from seeds. For vegetative propagation, existing globe artichoke plants should be divided in Fall or Winter when the plant is dormant. Shoots should be selected from plants that produce well and should be removed when they reach a height of about 20 cm (8 in).

To remove the shoots, they should be cut from the mother plant at the root using a sharp knife and gently loosened from the soil and existing root ball. These separated shoots should then be planted in a freshly prepared bed. The roots should be set to a depth of 15 to 20 cm (6-8 in) and spaced 1.2 to 1.8 m (4-6 ft) apart. Closer spacing may lead to fewer secondary buds. During the first year, flower heads should not be harvested to allow the new plants to establish.

For seed propagation, artichoke seeds should be started indoors about two months before the last frost date in the respective area. The seeds should be sown 2.5 cm (1 in) deep in a seed-starting mix within small 4-inch pots. Generous sowing is recommended, as germination success is around 70%, and not all emerging seedlings will produce high-quality plants. Once the seedlings have been hardened and all danger of frost has passed, they can be transplanted outdoors. Plants should be spaced 0.9 m (3 ft) apart in rows that are also spaced 0.9 m (3 ft). After the first year, any plants not producing well should be removed to achieve a final spacing of 1.2 to 1.8 m (4-6 ft) between plants.

### General Care and Maintenance

During the growing season, globe artichokes benefit from the application of a balanced fertilizer once every month. It is crucial to keep the plants from drying out, so the soil should be kept consistently moist. Insufficient soil moisture and plant stress during bud formation can result in poorly formed, tough buds of lower quality that do not size well. On the other hand, over- irrigation and long-term soil saturation should be avoided, particularly for heavier soils.

To conserve soil moisture, applying a thick mulch is recommended. However, the mulch should be removed when the plants begin to bud, and a generous layer of compost should be used instead. After harvest, the plant stems should be cut back to ground level or slightly below the soil line. For winter protection, the plants' roots should be mulched with plenty of organic mulch, such as about 20cm/8 in of straw and/or leaves. Additionally, covering the plants with a cardboard or styrofoam box filled with straw and leaves can further protect them during winter.

### Harvesting

Globe artichoke flower buds should be harvested before they start to open. Smaller, immature heads are more tender than older buds that are closer to opening. The buds color and appearance subtly change as they reach the harvest stage.

Using a sharp knife, the buds should be cut from the plant, leaving a 2.5 to 7.5 cm (1-3 in) section of stem with each bud. After harvesting all the buds from a plant, the plant should be cut down to the ground. Harvested buds should be inspected for insects, disease, and cosmetic damage.

Under proper cold storage conditions, artichokes can store well for three to four weeks. The ideal storage temperature ranges from 32º to 34ºF, with humidity levels between 90 percent and 95 percent.

# Arugula

## Description

Arugula, Eruca sativa , is a leafy annual vegetable in the family Brassicaceae which is grown as a salad green. The arugula plant possesses a rosette of basal leaves which grow low to the ground. The leaves of the plant are deeply lobed and dull green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or light yellow flowers which will develop into a seeded fruit. Arugula will reach maturity after 45–60 days and can reach a height of 20–100 cm (7.9–39.4 in). Arugula originates from the Mediterranean regions of Morocco and Portugal.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Eruca sativa

Common Name: rocket (En); roquette (Fr); rucola (Italian); rugula (Sp)

## Uses & Benefits

Arugula is a leafy green vegetable that's low in sugar, calories, and fat, but high in essential nutrients like calcium, potassium, folate, and vitamin C. It's also packed with antioxidants and glucosinolates, which may help combat inflammation and promote overall health. Arugula is an excellent source of vitamin K, which is essential for bone health and may help prevent osteoporosis.

Arugula leaves are sharp tasting and can be used in salads or as a seasoning. They can also be cooked prior to consumption.

## Propagation

### Basic requirements

Arugula is best grown in the cooler temperatures of Spring and Fall as summer temperatures trigger flowering and the leaves become excessively bitter. Arugula grows best in full sun in a rich, well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 8.0. The plants can tolerate some light shade, particularly in hotter temperatures.

### Planting

Arugula is commonly direct seeded and can be planted 1 to 2 weeks before the last frost date. Seeds can also be started indoors 4-6 weeks prior to the last frost to get a head start on the growing season. Arugula grows best in cool temperatures but can be damaged by frosts so it is best to provide it with cover if a late frost is forecast. Plant seeds by sprinkling on the ground and lightly covering with soil. Keep the soil moist. The seeds should germinate in 3 to 10 days.

### Harvesting

Arugula is ready to harvest in about 40 days. Harvest leaves from the outside of the plant by pinching them off with your fingers or snipping them with a pair of scissors. The center of the plant should be left undisturbed to promote new growth.

# Asparagus

## Description

Asparagus, Asparagus officinalis , is an herbaceous perennial plant in the family Asparagaceae which is grown for its young shoots, or spears, which are eaten as a vegetable. The asparagus plant is tall with scale like leaves emerging from the underground stem (rhizome) and has stout stems and feathery foliage. The flowers are bell shaped and occur alone or in pairs. They are green-white to yellow in color. After flowering, a round red berry is formed with 1 to 6 black seeds. Asparagus can live for 20 or more years and can attain a height between 100–150 cm (39.4–59.1 in). Asparagus originates from Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Asparagus officinalis

## Uses & Benefits

Asparagus spears can be eaten raw or cooked. They are low in calories and very low in sodium. Asparagus is a particularly good source of vitamin B6, calcium, magnesium , zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, rutin, niacin, folic acid, iron, phosphorus, potassium, copper, manganese, selenium, chromium, dietary fiber, and protein.

## Propagation

### Basic requirements

Asparagus grows best in regions with hot days and cool nights and requires 90–150 days of cold temperature to break dormancy. It will grow in most soils as long as they are well-draining and will grow optimally at a pH between 6.5 and 7.0. Asparagus should be planted in a sunny location in the home garden and it is best to avoid low lying areas as a late frost will cause damage to newly emerged spears.

Growing from seed

Growing asparagus from seed is more time consuming and labor intensive than growing from divided crowns. If growing from seed, be aware that you will be unable to harvest the spears for longer than if grown from crowns (spears can generally be harvested in the third year after planting). Asparagus seeds should be sown indoors 12 to 14 weeks before planting outside. This should be timed so that the outdoor planting date is after all danger of frost for your area. Seeds should be sown in mix, planting 0.6 cm (0.25 in) deep. The seeds should be kept moist, but not wet and will germinate in approximately 3 weeks. Seedlings should be fully hardened off prior to planting outdoors, using a cold frame where possible.

### Transplanting

The asparagus nursery bed should be prepared in advance by digging deeply to break up the soil and incorporating plenty of organic matter such as well- rotted manure and by blending a complete fertilizer into the soil just prior to transplanting. Plant the seedlings 25 to 38 cm (10-25 in) apart in a trench approximately 10 cm (4 in) deep. The trench should be gradually filled in as the seedlings grow. Keep the soil moist by providing about 2.5 cm (1 in) of water weekly. Once the plants are established, irrigation is generally only required in very dry areas due to the deep root system that the plant produces. It is important to control weeds as not only will it prevent any competition with the asparagus plant but it will also ensure that the young spears can be seen and harvested at the correct time. The asparagus plants should be transplanted to their final planting site in the second year following the directions for planting crowns (below).

### Planting crowns

When purchasing asparagus crowns, choose disease-free, 1 year old crowns from a reputable grower. All-male hybrids tend to be produce more spears than females and are a good choice for growing at home. Crowns should be planted once the soil has warmed to 10°C (50°F). Dig a trench 12 to 15 cm (5-6 in) deep and add super phosphate fertilizer to provide the crowns with nutrients immediately after planting. Position the crowns in the trench 30 to 45 cm (12-17 in) apart. It does not matter how the crown are oriented in the trench as they will grow regardless. Backfill the trench to the original level. If planting more than one row, allow at least 1.5 m (5 ft) between rows. New spears should begin to emerge from the soil within a week of planting. Avoid harvesting the spears until the following year. Allowing the ferns to develop and provide energy for the crown to produce spears the following year.

### Harvesting spears

Allow asparagus ferns to remain until the Spring before cutting or mowing them back to the ground to allow new spears to grow. The new spears are ready to harvest when they reach 17 to 22 cm (7-9 in) in length. The spears can simply be snapped by hand close to the ground. The spears can be harvested every 2 to 4 days for a period of 4 to 6 weeks in the second year (third year if grown from seed). Avoid over-harvesting as this will decrease the yield the following year. The harvest can be extended in the third year (fourth for seed grown plants) to 6-8 weeks.

# Avocado

## Description

Avocado, Persea americana , is an evergreen tree in the family Lauraceae which grown for its nutritious fruit, the avocado. The avocado tree is large and dome shaped with oval or elliptical leaves arranged in a spiral on the tips of branches. The leaves have a red pigmentation when they first emerge and turn green as they mature. Avocado trees produce clusters of small, green-yellow flowers at the end of twigs and a large, fleshy, pear-shaped fruit with a single large seed. The fruits can be purple to green in color with smooth or warty skin depending on variety. The flesh of the fruit is yellow-green in color and has the consistency of butter. Each fruit contains one large seed. Avocado trees grown from seed can take 4–6 years to produce fruit whereas grafted plants may produce fruit within 1–2 years. The tree can reach a height of 20 m (65.6 ft) and originated in the rainforests of Central America.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Persea americana

Common Name: avocado, alligator pear (En); aguacate, palta (Sp); parachichi (Sw)

## Uses & Benefits

The avocado is usually consumed fresh as a fruit or as an ingredient in salads or savory dishes. It has a markedly higher fat content than other fruits and is a staple in diets that have limited access to foods with high contents of monounsaturated fats. It is the main ingredient in guacamole, a popular Mexican dip. In Asia, avocados are used in desserts and dessert drinks.

Avocados are a source of vitamins C, E, K, and B6, as well as magnesium and potassium.

## Varieties of Avocado

There are three horticultural races in which all avocado varieties are classified: Guatemalan, West Indian, and Mexican. However, many commercially interesting varieties are hybrids.

Some examples of Mexican race varieties are Zutano, Fuerte, Puebla, and Teague, while some examples of Guatemalan race varieties are Hass and Reed, among others. West Indian race varieties include Waldin, Hardy, and Simmonds.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Avocados thrive in subtropical or tropical climates but can also be grown successfully in cooler areas of the world. The optimum temperature for growing avocado is between 25 and 33°C (77–91.4°F) with moderate humidity levels. Once established, trees can tolerate temperatures down to around -2°C (28°F) with minimal damage but young trees will not tolerate freezing temperatures. Avocado requires a well draining, aerated soil and they produce a shallow root system which require a warm soil for efficient water and nutrient uptake. Although trees will tolerate low rainfall, irrigation, particularly during flowering and fruit set, will ensure high fruit yields.

### Seeding

Avocados are commonly propagated from seeds but the seeds will not breed true due to type and this should be taken into consideration before planting. Clonal plants are obtained from budding and grafting from a parent tree to ensure the offspring are of the same high quality of the parent. In plantations, seeds can be sown directly in the soil. 2 to 3 seeds are usually sown and thinned later to leave the strongest seedling for grafting. Seeds may also be sown in containers and grown for 2 to 3 months before planting at the final site.

Avocado seedling should ideally be planted in the Spring when the soil has warmed through. Choose a location that receives full sun and has protection from the wind. The trees should be planted by digging a hole a little wider than the root ball and gently easing the tree into the hole. Slow release fertilizer can be added to the hole at planting but is not necessary. Care should be taken not to disturb the roots as much as possible and the hole should be carefully backfilled and the soil and tamped to prevent dislodging. Trees should be planted 4.5 to 6 m (15–20 ft) apart in rows spaced 6 m (20 ft) apart.

### General Care and Maintenance

Newly planted young trees should be mulched after planting with several inches of straw or woodchips. Young trees will also benefit from staking which will help to prevent wind damage. Wood stakes should be driven into the ground outside the root ball allowing 2 stakes per tree. The tree should then be tied loosely to the stakes to provide support while it establishes.

Young trees should be irrigated and the root ball should not be allowed to dry out. Trees should be watered every few days. Water trees at and around the base to ensure the root ball is wetted. Trees are usually fertilized at around 4 weeks after planting. Add half a cup of urea every 4 to 6 weeks during the growing season. One avocado tree can yield 250-300 kg of fruit per harvest season. This causes a high demand on soil nutrients. To determine the right amount of manure to apply, the soil should be tested annually.

Initial pruning may be done to give the tree a good shape. Otherwise pruning is limited to the removal of dead wood and parasitic plants. Remove all sucker and dead branches from main trunk branches. Prune canopy to keep the tree to a height of 5-8 m and for ease of picking. The tree is very susceptible to sunburn, therefore pruning should be minimised. Prune the larger tree roots by cultivating to a depth of 50 cm around the edge of the tree canopy.The area around the tree should be kept clean by weeding and removal of all fallen fruits.

### Harvest

Harvesting starts at 3-4 years from planting but a good yield is obtained from the 6th year onwards. It is not easy to tell when the fruits are ready for harvesting unless they are of the varieties that change colour at maturity. Harvest a sample and keep at room temperature. If they soften within 7-10 days without shrivelling then the fruit of that age are ready for harvesting.

# Azolla

## Description

Azolla, Azolla pinnata, an aquatic fern from the Azollacea plant family, is largely used as cattle fodder. With a main stem and pinnate side branches, azolla is a tiny branching plant. They resemble duckweed or other mosses more than other conventional ferns because of how reduced and specialized they are.

The side branches are longer at the base of the stem than at the top giving the fronds a roughly triangular shape. Each frond is composed of many overlapping rounded leaves which are covered in tiny hairs on their upper surface. Fronds are bright green in color, but they can take on a reddish tint when they are exposed to direct sunshine. On the water's surface, floated fronds resemble red velvet. Individual fronds can grow to a length of 1.5 to 2.5 cm (0.6-1.0 in).

Azolla is a plant whose native habitat stretches from Africa through India, Southeast Asia, and Australia.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Azolla pinnata

Common Name: feathery mosquito fern, red azolla, water velvet (En); afrikanischer algenfarn (German); aka-ukikusa (Japan)

## Uses & Benefits

The Azolla plant is commonly grown as a fodder plant for animals and as a companion plant for rice since it fixes nitrogen and suppresses weeds. It is rich in proteins, amino acids, vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin B12, Beta Carotene) and minerals.

It can be used as a bio-fertilizer by fixing atmospheric nitrogen and storing it in its leaves. This can help to improve crop yields.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Azolla must be grown in freshwater or moist mud in order to flourish since if allowed to dry out, the plants will die within a few hours. The plants spread quickly and can be grown in ponds or specially constructed pits. Strong water currents could damage the plant's fronds if it is cultivated in water, hence there should be little to no current.

The ideal conditions for azolla growth are in standing water that is 4 to 7 pH and between 5 and 12 cm (2.0–4.7 in) depth. It requires fully composted manure for nutrients and about two feet of root space. Azolla is sensitive to salinity and requires water with a high phosphorus content.

Plants will grow optimally at temperatures between 20 and 28°C (68-82.4°F) in partial shade or full sunlight. Heavily shaded areas should be avoided.

### Seeding

Propagation Azolla is first cultivated by seeding,either by throwing or gently rubbing Azolla in your hands and spreading it in.a prepared pit or pond. The azolla will rapidly colonize the water and start reproducing on its own.

### General Care and Maintenance

To ensure the health of the Azolla crop, organic phosphate supplements and cow dung slurry should be added every five days. This helps to maintain the mineral and nutrient levels in the water and keep the crop healthy. It is essential to replace 25-30% of the old water with fresh water every ten days. Doing so would prevent nitrogen buildup and keep the water clean. It is also recommended to replace the entire water and soil every six months and add fresh Azolla seeds to prevent the crop from getting infected with diseases

### Harvest

To enable the plant to recolonize, some of the harvest ought to be set aside. To keep the pond from being too congested, plant materials should be collected after every three days. The harvested Azolla can be used to feed animals directly or dried for later use.


# Banana

## Description

Banana, Musa paradisiaca, is a type of fruit that grows on a large herbaceous plant that is native to Southeast Asia. It is one of the world's most popular and widely grown fruit, with many varieties being cultivated for both commercial and home use. Bananas are long, curved fruits with smooth, yellow, and sometimes slightly green skin. The average length of a banana is about 7 to 9 inches, and it is about 2 to 3 inches in diameter. The skin of the banana is usually yellow when it is ripe, but it can also be green, red, or purple depending on the variety.

The inside of a banana is composed of several fleshy, cream-colored segments, which are surrounded by thin, white membranes. The flesh of the banana is soft, slightly sweet, and has a slightly sticky texture.

Bananas are one of the most popular and widely grown fruits in the world, with their largest production occurring in countries near the equator. They thrive in tropical and subtropical climates and are commonly grown in India, China, the Philippines, Ecuador, Brazil, Uganda, Colombia, Indonesia, Cameroon, and Honduras. However, this is not an exhaustive list, as bananas are also grown in other tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The specific areas where bananas are grown can vary based on local growing conditions, including temperature, rainfall, soil type, and market demand.

### Crop details

Scientific Name: Musa paradisiaca

Common Name: banana (Sp); banane (Fr); Банан (Rus)

## Uses & Benefits

Bananas are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin B6, and potassium, and are often used as a healthy snack or ingredient in smoothies and other foods.The fruit is the most widely used part of the plant and can be eaten fresh or cooked or processed into starch, chips, puree, beer, vinegar or dehydrated to produce dried fruit. The fruit may also be processed into flour which is used in baking, soups or beverages. The flowers of the plant may be used as a vegetable. Fresh leaves have a high protein content and can be fed to cattle. Other uses for leaves include polishing floors, lining pots or wrapping food.

## Varieties of Bananas

There are many different varieties of bananas, ranging in size, color, flavor, and texture. Some of the most common and widely grown varieties include:

## Propagation

### Basic Requirement

Bananas are a tropical crop that grow best in warm, humid conditions with abundant rainfall. The ideal temperature range for growing bananas is between 20°C and 30°C, with a preferred temperature range of 25°C to 28°C. High humidity levels are also important for supporting healthy growth and fruit production. Bananas require a minimum of 1000mm of rainfall or irrigation per year to support growth and fruit production. However, it is important to note that the specific climatic requirements may vary depending on the variety of banana being grown and local growing conditions. It is essential to work with local agriculture experts to ensure that the right climatic conditions are in place for successful banana cultivation.

Bananas grow best in well-drained, fertile soils with a high organic matter content. They require good aeration and a pH of 5.5 to 7.0. They are also sensitive to soil-borne diseases and to combat this problem, old suckers can also be replaced by young ones.

Bananas require regular watering, especially during the dry season, to support growth and fruit production. Over-watering or waterlogging can lead to root rot, so it is important to ensure good drainage and to avoid standing water around the plants. Drip irrigation systems are commonly used for banana cultivation to conserve water and reduce the risk of disease.

### Seeding

The crop is propagated through vegetative reproduction, meaning new plants are produced from existing plant material rather than from seeds. The most common method of propagation is through the use of "suckers" or "pups," which are shoots that grow from the base of the mother plant. The suckers are carefully removed from the mother plant and planted in a new location, where they will develop into a separate plant. When cutting sucker from the parent plant, remove all but the top 2-3 leaves. In commercial banana farming, the suckers are often treated with rooting hormones to encourage faster and more vigorous growth.

Another method of propagation is through the use of "rhizome" or "corm" cuttings, which are pieces of the underground stem of the banana plant that can be used to start a new plant. This method is less common but may be used in some cases, particularly for rare or specialty varieties of bananas.

Planting bananas may vary depending on the variety being grown and local growing conditions. It is important to work with local agriculture experts or PlantVillage officers to ensure the best planting and growing practices for your specific situation. Start by selecting a suitable site for growing bananas, taking into consideration factors such as soil type, drainage, and climatic conditions. Test the soil pH and fertility and amend as necessary.

Dig a hole in the soil 45x45x45 cm in size and 3m x 3m apart that is large enough to accommodate the roots of the sucker. When digging, place the top black soil on the upper side of the hole and brown or subsoil on the lower side. Place the sucker in the hole, making sure the top of the roots is level with the soil surface, leaving a dome-shaped valley on the surface. Backfill the soil around the roots and water thoroughly.

### General Care and Maintenance

Apply a layer of organic mulch around the plant to conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Bananas require regular watering, especially during dry periods. Make sure the soil is consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Bananas need regular fertilization to support healthy growth and fruit production. Apply a balanced fertilizer, such as 10-10-10, at the recommended rate, according to soil test results. Prune off the older, lower leaves of the plant as they yellow to keep the plant healthy and improve air circulation.

### Harvesting

Banana harvesting is the process of collecting ripe or near-ripe bananas from the plant. The timing of the harvest is crucial, as it will determine the quality of the fruit and its intended use. To harvest bananas, one must first identify when the fruit is mature, which can be determined by observing signs such as yellowing of the fruit and leaves. Once the bananas are ready to be harvested, a sharp, clean knife should be used to cut the stem of the banana bunch from the plant. It's important to handle the bananas carefully to avoid bruising, and to gently place them in a container or on a flat surface for transport. If the bananas are harvested when they are still green, they will need to be ripened before eating by placing them in a warm, well-ventilated area until they are yellow and soft to the touch. Ripe bananas can be stored at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator to slow down the ripening process. The exact procedures for harvesting bananas may vary depending on the variety of banana being grown and local growing conditions. It's recommended to work with local agriculture experts, such as those from PlantVillage, to ensure the best harvesting and handling practices for your specific situation.

# Barley

## Description

Barley, Hordeum vulgare , is an edible annual grass in the family Poaceae grown as a cereal grain crop. It is a tall grass with a hairy stem that stands erect and produces spikelets at the head. Barley is classified under the genus "Hordeum" and the species "vulgare." It's an important cereal crop that belongs to the Poaceae family and is widely cultivated for its various uses in human consumption and industry.

The nodes and internodes make up the stem. The internodes are hollow, as opposed to the solid internodes. The inflorescence, or spike, where the grain is generated, is supported by the stalk.

The heads of the barley seeds are triangular spikes made up of rachis and three spikelets apiece. 20–60 grains are produced by each spike. Barley plants freely tiller and usually have one to six stems. Seed heads are not produced by the tillers. An annual crop, barley may grow to a height of 80 to 100 cm (31.5–39.4 in) and is harvested every year. Barley was initially domesticated in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East and is sometimes referred to as spring barley or winter barley.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Hordeum vulgare

Common Name: common barley (En); cebada (Sp); gérste (German); orge (Fr)

## Uses & Benefits

Barley is cultivated as a food cereal in the tropics and subtropics in India, Nepal, Tibet, Afghanistan, Russia, Ethiopia, North Africa, and the Andean region of South America. The straw produced is used as animal feed, bedding, and to cover the roofs of houses.In temperate regions, barley is used in malt production to brew beer and make other distilled alcoholic beverages, particularly whisky. Barley flour is a staple grain in North Africa and parts of Asia, used to make unleavened flatbread and porridge.

It is a high-carbohydrate food with moderate amounts of protein, calcium, and phosphorus, as well as small amounts of B vitamins.

## Varieties of Barley

There are two main varieties of barley, each with its own characteristics and uses, distinguished by the number of rows of flowers on its flower spike. These varieties include:

Two-row barley: Two-row barley has two types of florets - central florets that produce kernels and lateral florets that don't produce anything. Two-row barley is used more often for malt production because it contains more sugar.

Six-row barley: It has its spike that is notched on opposite sides, with three spikelets at each notch, each containing a small flower that becomes a kernel. Six-row barley is mostly used for animal feed because it has more protein.

## Propagation

Basic requirements Barley is a cool-season crop and thrives in temperate climates. It prefers moderate temperatures during its growth stages. During its growth phases, it prefers warmer temperatures. During the growth season, the ideal temperature ranges for barley cultivation are between 15 and 20 °C (59 and 68 °F). Frost may be tolerated by barley to some extent, but excessive cold or heat could damage the plant's development.

Barley can be grown in a range of soil types, but it prefers well-drained soils with good water-holding capacity. Loamy soils with good organic matter content are generally ideal for barley cultivation. Heavy clay soils can hinder root growth and drainage, while sandy soils may require more frequent irrigation.

Choose a well-drained field with good sunlight exposure and prepare the soil by plowing or tilling to a depth of 6-8 inches. Remove weeds, rocks, and debris from the field. Incorporate organic matter or compost to improve soil structure and fertility.

### Growing from Seed

When planting, choose high-quality barley seeds from reputable sources. Select a suitable barley variety based on your region's climate and intended use (e.g., malting, feed, or forage).

Create a smooth and level seedbed to ensure uniform germination and emergence. You can use harrows or other suitable equipment to achieve this. Barley can be sown either by broadcasting or drilling. Drilling is preferred for precise seed placement and even spacing. The recommended seeding rate varies depending on the variety, but a typical range is around 90–120 kg/ha (80–110 lbs/acre).

Plant barley seeds at a depth of about 1-2 inches (2.5–5 cm). Row spacing can vary, but a common recommendation is around 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) between rows.

### General Care and Maintenance

Barley requires adequate moisture, especially during its early growth stages. Proper irrigation is important to ensure uniform germination and establishment. However, overwatering should be avoided to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root diseases. Depending on the local climate and rainfall patterns, barley can be grown as rainfed or irrigated crop. In areas with reliable rainfall, rainfed barley can be successful. In drier regions, irrigation is necessary to supplement water needs. Water stress during critical growth stages, such as flowering and grain filling, can significantly reduce yield. Proper irrigation timing is essential to support these stages.

Mulching can help conserve soil moisture, reduce evaporation, and suppress weed growth. This can be particularly beneficial in areas with limited water availability.

Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test results and local recommendations. Barley has specific nutrient requirements, especially for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

Monitor the field for weeds and control them using appropriate methods. Early weed management is crucial to prevent competition with young barley plants. Implement integrated pest management practices to control pests and diseases. Common barley pests include aphids, cutworms, and rust diseases.

### Harvesting

Barley is ready to harvest when the stalks and heads have turned from green to yellow and the seed heads are drooping towards the ground. Check the seeds for ripeness before harvest. They should be firm and crunchy and not doughy in texture. Commercially produced wheat is usually harvested using a combine. Smaller plots can be harvested by hand using a scythe or sickle. Small plots can be harvested by snipping off the heads with a pair of scissors.

Please note that specific procedures may vary based on your location, local conditions, and the type of barley you're planting. It's always a good idea to consult with local agricultural experts or extension services for guidance tailored to your region.

# Basil

## Description

Basil, Ocimum basilicum , is a short lived annual or perennial plant in the family Lamiaceae grown for its leaves which are used as a herb. The basil plant grows from a thick taproot and has silky green opposite (paired) oval leaves which grow to be 3–11 cm (1.2–4.3 in) long and 1–6 cm (0.4–2.4 in), branching out from the central stem. The plant produces small white flowers which are clustered on a single spike at the top of the plant. Basil plants are often grown as annuals but may survive for several seasons with some care and can reach heights between 30 and 130 cm (11.8 and 51.2 in) depending on the variety. Basil may also be referred to as sweet basil, St. Joseph's wort, thai basil, lemon basil or holy basil depending on the variety and is native to India and other tropical regions of Asia.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Ocimum basilicum

Common Name: basilico (Italian); basilic (Fr); तुलसी (Hindi); โหระพา (Thai)

## Uses & Benefits

Basil is an annual herb of the mint family (Lamiaceae), grown for its aromatic leaves. Basil is likely native to India and is widely grown as a kitchen herb. The leaves are used fresh or dried to flavour meats, fish, salads, and sauces; basil tea is a stimulantBasil is commonly used as a fresh or dried herb in cooking and is popularly used in beverages in Southeast Asia.

Essential oil can be extracted from the leaves and used in cosmetics, dental products and perfume.

## Varieties

The following are some of the common basil varieties;

Thai basil: It is commonly used in Thai and Southeast Asian cuisine and adds a sweet licorice flavor to a dish)

Lemon basil : It has small leaves with a tangy lemon flavor.

Cinnamon basil: It is native to Mexico and adds a hint of cinnamon to a dish (typically paired with legumes or spicy stir-fried vegetables).

Sweet basil: It is commonly found in Italian dishes and is very popular. It has a unique taste that is similar to licorice and clove.

## Propagation

### Basic requirements

Basil is a warm season crop which will grow optimally in areas where daytime temperatures are consistently above 21°C (70°F) and nighttime temperatures stay above 10°C (50°F). Basil is very sensitive to frost and will need protected if a late cold snap is forecast. The plant will grow best in a fertile, moist soil with a pH between 6 and 7. Basil requires around 6–8 hours of sun every day and benefits from some shade in the afternoon.

### Growing from Seed

Basil seeds should be sown indoors 6–8 weeks before planting outside. Sow seeds in a sterile seed starting mix in seed trays or pots 0.2–1.0 cm (0.08–0.4 in) deep and water gently. Ensure the temperature remains between 15.5 and 27°C (60–80°F). Seeds should germinate in about 5 days at 21°C (70°F).

### General Care and Maintenance

Basil seedlings can be transplanted to the garden when they are between 6 and 8 weeks old, about 2 weeks after the last frost date. Plants should be spaced approximately 30 cm (12 in) apart, allowing 45 cm (18 in) between rows. Pinching back the growing tip of the plants after transplanting will encourage the growth of new shoots. Apply mulch to help retain soil moisture and minimizes weeds around the plants. Watering should be done more often if the crop is grown outdoors. To prevent downy mildew, water the base of the crop instead of the leaves and stems. Manual weeding is encouraged and should be done carefully. Weeds close to the plants should be cut off at ground level.

### Harvesting

Basil leaves can begin to be harvested any time after the plants have reached a height of 15–20 cm (6–8 in). Harvest leaves by pinching the leaves from the tips of the stems to encourage the more branching. Leaves should be pinched regularly to keep the plants productive and prevent them from going to seed.

# Bean

## Description

Bean, Phaseolus vulgaris , is a versatile legume widely cultivated across the globe for its edible pods and seeds. Belonging to the Fabaceae family and Phaseolus genus, it encompasses numerous varieties with distinct characteristics and uses. Originally from the Latin America, beans are vital for food security in many parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. They thrive in various agroecological zones, from lowlands to highlands, and from arid to humid regions.

This staple crop is extensively cultivated in countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Nigeria, among others. The types of beans grown include bush beans, green beans, and kidney beans, each offering unique flavors and culinary uses. Bean varieties exhibit diverse pod shapes, colors, and sizes. Pods range from flat to round, with hues spanning from green and yellow to red and purple. Beans themselves vary in shape, from nearly spherical to elongated and kidney-shaped. Beans are primarily grown as either bush or climbing plants, requiring support for harvesting in the latter case. Varieties differ in pod fibrousness and seed quality, with colors ranging from white through various shades to black.

These legumes play a crucial role in global agriculture, providing essential nutrients and contributing to dietary diversity. They are a staple in many cuisines worldwide and are valued for their versatility and nutritional benefits.

### Crop details

Scientific Name: Phaseolus vulgaris L.

Common Name: bush beans, common beans, dry beans, dwarf beans, field beans, garden beans, kidney beans (En); haricot (Fr); feijão (portuguese); fagiolo (Italian)

## Uses & Benefits

The common bean is used as a pulse and green vegetable eaten fresh or cooked. The beans can be dried, cooked in sauce and canned .The common bean is used as a pulse and green vegetable eaten fresh or cooked. The beans can be dried, cooked in sauce and canned.

Beans are among some of the oldest cultivated vegetables. There are various types of beans that differ with shapes, sizes, taste and nutritional facts. Kidney beans, pinto beans, broad beans, fava beans, lima beans, etc. are some of the different types of beans. Each of them is loaded with dietary fibers, proteins and major vitamins and minerals like vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The amount of the above given nutrients varies from one type of bean to other. Beans are very low in fat and cholesterol and they also help to lower the bad cholesterol in the body. Since they are high in proteins, they make an excellent meat substitute for vegetarians. They are extremely low in calories and hence are a favorite food among the calorie conscious people. Before knowing more about beans nutritional value, let us take a look at some figures related to nutrition in beans.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Common beans are warm-season crops and should be planted after all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed. Beans will grow best at soil temperatures between 15.5 and 29°C (60–85°F) and are sensitive to cold temperatures and frosts. Beans will grow best in a fertile, well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.75 Beans will perform best in full sunlight.

### Growing from Seed

Beans should be direct seeded in the garden in when the soil has reached a temperature of at least 15.5°C (60°F), with the optimum temperature for germination being between 15.5 and 29°C (60–85°F). Planting at cooler temperatures leads to slow germination and promotes seed rotting. Seeds should be planted 2.5–3.5 cm (1–1.5 in) deep. Bush beans should be planted 5–10 cm (2–4 in) apart allowing 0.6–0.9 m ( 2–3 ft) between rows. Pole beans can be planted in both row and hills. In rows, seeds should be spaced 15–25 cm (6–10 in) apart allowing 0.9–1.2 m (3–4 ft) between rows. For a continuous harvest of beans over the summer months, make new plantings every 2–3 weeks.

### General Care and Maintenance

Pole beans should be provided with a pole or trellis to climb on to support the weight of the pods and allow light to penetrate to all parts of the plant, helping to prevent disease. Bean poles should have a rough surface to help the plant to grip and should be 1.8–2.1 m (6–7 ft) long. Three or four poles can be used to form a tripod onto which the plants can be trained. Bean trellises can be constructed easily using posts (or a tripod arrangement of poles), wire and twine. Position a post at either end of the area in which you wish to plant a row of beans and connect with two lengths of wire. The first wire should be approximately 13 cm (5 in) from the ground, and the second 1.5–1.8 m (5–6 ft) from the ground. Finally, use the twine to create a V-shaped trellis by tying the twine to the bottom wire, bringing it up to the top wire and looping it back down around the bottom wire. Continue to zigzag the string all the way along the wires to the second support before tying the twine off. A rough textured twine is best as it will encourage the plant to climb and twine around it. Pinch back the growing tips of the plants once they reach the top support to encourage the plant to branch.

Mulching with straw and cut grasses helps conserve moisture, promote adventitious root development and enhances tolerance to bean fly maggot damage.

Beans are excellent for intercropping with other food crops, such as maize, potatoes, celery, cucumber and can help supply the other crops with nitrogen to a limited degree. Longer season varieties of beans can fix higher amounts of nitrogen than short season varieties. Intercropping with chives or garlic helps repel aphids (KIOF - personal communication).

A regular water supply is essential for French beans as moisture affects yields, uniformity and quality. Water stress during flowering reduces yields, as does waterlogging. Irrigation in dry spells is recommended as 35 mm per week at planting and 10 days post emergence, followed by 50 mm per week thereafter till end of production.

### Harvesting

Beans are generally ready for harvest approximately two weeks after bloom. The beans should be harvested just before the seeds are mature and before they form bumps on the pod. The pods should be firm and snap when they are bent. Pick beans every 2–3 days to ensure the plants remain productive. Pinch beans rather than pulling to avoid damaging the plant. Cut pole beans from the plant using scissors.

## Varieties of Beans

The following are the different types of beans.

Black Beans: are a staple in many Mexican and Brazilian dishes. They have a velvety-smooth texture and mild flavor. They also have a lower glycemic index than many other high-carb foods, helping to reduce the spike in blood sugar that occurs after eating a meal.

Black-Eyed Peas :This Southern staple has a beige hue with an eye-catching black spot, hence the name "black-eyed peas." They have an earthy flavor that complements salty foods like ham and bacon .

Cannellini Beans: Also known as white Italian kidney beans, these cream- colored beans are one of the most common types of beans. They are a popular addition to soups, salads, and many Italian dishes.

Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans ): They have a round shape and a firm texture, making them a great salad topping.

Great Northern Beans : This is another type of white bean that is often mistaken for cannellini or navy beans

Kidney Beans : These beans are known for their vibrant red skin and white interior. They have a mild flavor, and make the perfect addition to any chili recipe.

Lima Beans : These beans get a bad rap, but there's actually so much to love when it comes to lima beans. They can be white, creamy, or green in color.

Pinto Beans : Pinto beans have an orange-pink color with rust-colored specks

Fava Beans : Fava beans, or broad beans, can be difficult to work with. They require that you remove them from their pods and then blanch them in order to get the skins off.

Navy Beans :This bean goes by many names: haricot, pearl haricot beans, white pea bean, and Boston bean. They have a mild flavor and creamy texture, and similar to Great Northern Beans, they do a great job of absorbing the flavors around them.

Adzuki Beans : These small, round red beans , Like other legumes, they're protein-packed and high in fiber.

Edamame : Edamame are young soybeans which are usually eaten while still inside the pod.

Cranberry Beans : Rounding out the list are these striking cream-colored beans with red speckles. Also known as borlotti beans, cranberry beans have a creamy texture and a nutty flavor.

Soybeans : Soybeans are dried and beige in color.

Mung Beans : These beans are one of the most consumed types in the world. They are small, round, and green with a white stripe going through them. They have a mild flavor and a starchy texture

# Beet

## Description

Beets, Beta vulgaris, are herbaceous biennial root vegetables in the family Chenopodiaceae grown for their edible root and young leaves. The plant is usually erect with a long main root and a rosette of leaves growing on stems.

The leaves are oval in shape, arranged alternately on the stem and grow 20–40 cm (7.9–15.7 in) in length. The roots are usually red, purple, white or golden in color and either round or cylindrical. Leaves are similar to their close relative Swiss chard. The plant produces sessile green flowers and can reach 1–2 m (3.3–6.6 ft) in height. Beets are usually grown as annual plants, harvested after one growing season.

Beets originated from the Mediterranean with Russia being the largest producer of sugar beets. They may also be referred to as beetroot, garden beet or spinach beet.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Beta vulgaris

Common Name: beetroot (En); barbabietola (Italian); betterave (Fr)

## Uses & Benefits

The roots are consumed after boiling and may be pickled in vinegar. The leaves of the spinach beet plant are consumed as a herb in Indonesia and Japan. Chemicals like betalain in the roots can be extracted and used as food coloring.

Beets contain a significant amount of vitamins A and C, calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, protein and carbohydrates. Beets are also high in folate, dietary fiber and antioxidants. They are high in betaine which is prescribed to lower toxic levels of homocysteine (Hcy) (which contributes to the development of heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease). The highest levels of vitamins and other nutrients are available when the vegetables are eaten raw. The beet greens are high in vitamin A.

## Varieties of Beet

Some of the varieties of beet include the following:

Red Beet: This is the most common and widely recognized beet variety. It has a deep red-purple flesh and skin. It contains an earthy and sweet flavor. Red beets are typically used in salads, pickling, and roasting.

Golden Beet: They have a vibrant yellow or golden flesh and a milder, sweeter flavor compared to red beets. They can be used in the same ways as red beets and are often preferred for their more delicate flavor.

Chioggia Beet: Also known as candy cane or candy stripe beets have pink and white rings on the inside creating a striking appearance. They have a mild, sweet flavor and are often used in salads to add a pop of color.

Cylindra Beet: Cylindra beets are elongated and cylindrical in shape, making them easy to slice and use in dishes like beet chips or for pickling. Contains a sweet and tender flavor.

Detroit Dark Red Beet: This heirloom variety is known for its deep, dark red color and sweet flavor. It's excellent for both fresh eating and canning.

Bull's Blood Beet: Bull's Blood beets have dark maroon leaves and deep red roots. They are often grown for their edible greens and are used in salads or as a colorful garnish. They have an earthy and slightly sweet taste.

White Beet: White beets have white flesh and a mild, slightly sweet flavor. They are less common than red or golden beets but can be used in various recipes.

Baby Beets: These are simply young beets harvested at an early stage when they are small and tender. They can be red, golden, or any other variety, and are often used in salads or as a side dish.

Forono Beet: These beets are short and cylindrical, making them easy to slice into uniform rounds for cooking or pickling. Contains a sweet and tender taste.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Beets are cool season vegetables with a long growing season. They grow best in cool climates but can tolerate some heat as well as some freezing. The optimum temperature for their growth is between 15.5 and 18.3°C (60–65°F). Beets grow best in a loose, well draining soil with a pH between 6.2 and 6.8 and should be planted in full sun for optimum development. They have a long taproot, therefore they like well drained soil that contain an abundant amount of organic matter.

### Growing from Seed

Beets are directly seeded and can be planted as soon as the soil is workable in Spring. The soil should be prepared for planting by ensuring land is well prepared with good drainage and enough organic matter.

The seeds are multi-germ clusters with two to five seeds. They are slow to germinate, so pre-soaking the seeds for 12 hours will encourage rapid and more even germination. Plant one seed every 2.5 cm (1 in) at a depth of 13 mm (0.5 in) in rows spaced 30–40 cm (12–16 in) apart. Keep the seedbed well watered. Seedlings should emerge in 5 to 17 days at temperatures between 10 and 24°C (50–75°F).

When seedlings have reached between 7 and 10 cm (3–4 in) in height, thin to a final spacing of 7–10 cm (3–4 in) between plants. For a continuous harvest, plant seeds every 2–3 weeks as long as the daytime temperature stays below 26.6°C (80°F). Most beet varieties mature in 55 to 70 days.

Beetroot takes about two months to grow from sowing to maturity, mature height of the plant is about 9 cm.

### General Care and Maintenance

Keep the area around your beet plants free of weeds, as they can compete for nutrients and water. Remove any weeds around plants by cultivating shallowly to avoid damaging the developing roots. Use mulch (such as straw or wood chips) to help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.

Thin beet seedlings when they are about 2-3 inches tall to provide adequate spacing between plants. This prevents overcrowding, allowing roots to develop properly. Leave the healthiest-looking seedlings, spacing them 3-4 inches apart in rows.

Test your soil to determine its nutrient content, and fertilize accordingly. Beets generally benefit from well-balanced, fertile soil. Beets also require an adequate supply of nutrients, particularly phosphorus. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer or organic compost before planting. Avoid excessive nitrogen, as it can lead to excessive leaf growth at the expense of root development.

Even watering will promote the development of good quality roots and prevent the formation of rings in the root. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Beets prefer even moisture to prevent cracking and toughening of the roots. Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry spells. Aim for at least 1 inch of water per week, either from rainfall or irrigation.

Practice crop rotation to prevent soil depletion and reduce the risk of disease. Avoid planting beets in the same spot in consecutive growing seasons.Beets prefer cool to moderate temperatures. If you're growing them in hot weather, consider providing some shade during the hottest parts of the day.

Keep an eye out for common beet pests such as aphids, leafhoppers, and leaf miners. Remove affected leaves or use organic pest control methods as needed. Practice crop rotation to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases. Beets are generally less susceptible to pests and diseases compared to some other crops, but it's still essential to monitor them regularly. In case of frost, cover young beet plants with row covers or cloths to protect them.

Regularly inspect your beet plants for signs of stress, disease, or pests. Early detection can help you address issues before they become severe. Remove any dead or diseased leaves to promote air circulation and overall plant health.

### Harvesting

Young beet greens can be harvested for salads when they are 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in) high and older greens before they reach 15 cm (6 in) in length. Roots are also ready for harvest when the foliage starts to go limp.

The roots are ready for harvest when they have reached 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter and are most tender before they exceed 7.5–10 cm (3–4 in).

Watering the soil the day before harvest or the day after rainfall makes pulling the beets easier. Pull beets out of the soil by firmly grasping the top and pulling the root out of the soil vertically. Alternatively, use a garden fork to dig the beets out of the soil. Cut the tops of the beets to 1.25–2.5 cm (0.5–1.0 in) above the root before storing the root. This helps keep the beets fresh.

Beets can be stored for long periods of time if they are very cool and very damp.

Once the top of the beets has been removed, roots are washed and stored in polythene bags to lengthen the shelf-life by reducing water loss during storage and transit.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Bergamot oranges grow best in regions with a pronounced change in season. They will grow best at temperatures between 12.8 and 37.8°C (55–100°F) during the growing season and 1.7 to 10°C (35–50°F) during dormancy. Mature trees can survive short periods of freezing, whereas young trees will be killed. Trees should be protected from frosts and freezing conditions to prevent damage.

The trees will also tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water- logged soil. Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. The soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development. Trees require full sun and should be protected from wind, which can cause damage to the trees.

### Propagation

Bergamot seedlings are usually produced by grafting or budding to an appropriate rootstock, as seeds will not produce fruit true to type. Grafting is the process by which a scion from one plant is joined to the rootstock of another to produce a new tree. Budding is a special type of grafting where the scion that is joined to the rootstock consists of a single bud. Budding is commonly used in citrus propagation as it is the easier of the two processes and works very well.

Budding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6–9 mm/0.25–0.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant).

Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden. The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which they will be joined. It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees. The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases, which can kill trees.

The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks that are 20–25 cm (8–10 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves. These budsticks can be stored for 2–3 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting. The simplest way to join the budwood to the rootstock is by T-budding. The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut should be approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground. Using a sharp knife, a 2.5–3.8 cm (1–1.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark.

A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a “T-shape” The horizontal cut should be made at a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark. Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud. This piece should measure 1.9–2.5 cm (0.75–1.0 in) in length. Immediately insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant. Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape. When the union is made and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem above the join, about 2/3 of the way through the stem. This cut should be made 2.5–3.9 cm (1.0–1.5 in) on the same side as the join. The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground. This process, known as "lopping,” allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in length, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.

### Planting Seedlings

Bergamot trees can be purchased as seedlings that have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard. The best time to plant citrus trees is in the spring, after all the danger of frost has passed in your area. Standard sized trees should be spaced 3.7–7.6 m (12–25 ft) apart in an area that receives full sunlight but is protected from strong winds, which can damage the trees. Planting against a south facing wall will help protect the tree in cooler climates.

### General Care and Maintenance

Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established. During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish themselves in the soil. Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3–7 days. The soil should be moist, but not wet. Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently. Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month in the first year.

### Harvesting

Harvesting bergamot, whether it's Monarda didyma (Bee Balm) or Citrus bergamia (Bergamot Orange), involves careful timing and consideration of the specific plant type. For Monarda didyma, which is often grown for its striking flowers and aromatic leaves, the best time to harvest is when the blooms are in full glory. To maintain the plant's health and encourage continuous flowering, it's advisable to trim the flowering stems, cutting them just above a pair of leaves while ensuring not to remove more than one-third of the plant's height at a time. On the other hand, Citrus bergamia, primarily cultivated for its fragrant peel, is harvested during the winter months when the fruit is ripe. The fruit should be gently hand-picked to avoid damage to the tree and then carefully peel the bergamot, capturing the valuable essential oils. Proper harvesting methods are essential to maintaining the quality and utility of the harvested material.

# Black pepper

## Description

Black pepper, Piper nigrum , is a climbing perennial plant in the family Piperaceae. It is mainly grown for its fruit, which is processed to create black, white, and green peppercorns, commonly used as a spice in cooking.

The plants of black pepper may have either vining or bushy, woody stems.The plant features simple, alternating leaves with an oval shape and produces clusters, or spikes, of 50 to 150 flowers. These flowers give rise to small, spherical green fruits that ripen to red.

Each stem has the potential to produce 20-30 of these spikes. While black pepper can grow to a height of 10 meters (33 feet) in the wild, under cultivation, it is usually maintained at a more manageable 3-4 meters (10-13 feet). Black pepper is a perennial plant with a lifespan of over 30 years, and it typically has a commercial lifespan of 12–20 years. This versatile spice is native to south and southeast Asia.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Piper nigrum

Common Name: pimentero (Sp); poivrier (Fr); pimenteiro (Portuguese).

## Uses & Benefits

Pepper is one of the oldest classic spices and is used as an ingredient in many spice mixtures, such as curry. Black pepper, white pepper, and green pepper all derive from the piper nigrum plant. The distinct types of pepper are obtained by harvesting at different stages of ripeness and applying different processing techniques.

Black pepper plants are cultivated to produce black, white, and green pepper. The processing methods vary for each type:-

Black pepper is the result of drying the fruit to produce the familiar black peppercorns.

White pepper is produced by soaking the fruits in water for about a week to recover the seed from the decomposed fruit.

Green pepper is produced by drying unripe fruit in a way that retains its green color. Green peppercorns are often preserved by pickling.

Pepper seeds contain various components, including essential oil, piperine, chavicine, piperidine, fatty oils, resin, starch, and water. The alkaloid piperine is primarily responsible for the sharp taste associated with pepper.

Black pepper packs vitamins (K, E, A, B) and minerals (manganese, copper, iron) for bone health, immunity, energy, and more.

## Varieties of Black Pepper

Among the numerous pepper varieties, only a select few are important as spices. These include:

Black pepper hails from India, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

Bengal pepper originates in the mountainous regions of the lower Himalayas.

Java pepper is native to Malaysia and Indonesia.

Ashanti pepper is indigenous to tropical Africa.

Kubeben pepper is found in Indonesia and Malaysia.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Black pepper (Piper nigrum) thrives in specific climatic conditions, which are crucial for its successful cultivation. Black pepper grows best in well- draining soils rich in organic matter.

The ideal soil pH for black pepper is around 5.5 to 6.5. It requires good soil aeration and texture for healthy root development. Black pepper is a tropical crop and prefers warm temperatures. The ideal temperature range for black pepper is 23°C to 32°C, with an average of 28°C. Adequate spacing is crucial for black pepper vines to grow well.

Typically, black pepper vines need about 3-4 meters of spacing between them, as they are climbers and require room to spread and climb. Black pepper plants require partial to full sunlight for healthy growth.

### Growing from Seed

Black pepper can be propagated using three main methods: dry seeds, cuttings, or stolons. Cuttings are the most common method for commercial production. They are typically taken from the secondary runners of the plant and should have one or two leaves. These cuttings are rooted in a seedbed and then transplanted when the plant has 4-7 new leaves.

In cultivation, a trellis is used to support the plant, and the trellis should be at least 4 meters (13 feet) high. When planting, black pepper should be spaced at 8 × 8 meters (26 × 26 feet), meaning 8 meters between individual plants and 8 meters between rows.

### General Care and Maintenance

Choose a suitable location with well-draining soil and partial sunlight. Plant black pepper vines in rows or on trellises, allowing them to climb. Maintain consistent moisture, as pepper plants prefer slightly damp soil. Avoid waterlogging, which can harm the roots.

Pests like aphids and scale insects are rampant; keep an eye on them. You can remove dead or diseased branches to avoid diseases. You will have to treat diseases like root rot promptly.

Apply a balanced fertilizer with micronutrients regularly. Use organic matter to enrich the soil. Trim and prune the vines to encourage bushier growth.

### Harvesting

Harvest black pepper when the berries turn from green to red or yellow, depending on the variety. Avoid picking unripe or overripe berries. Handpick the berries or use tools like shears for larger harvests. Be gentle to prevent damaging the vines.

Thresh the berries to separate them from the stems. Blanch, dry, clean, grade, and package the peppercorns for market distribution.

## Common Pests and Diseases

# Blackberry

## Description

Blackberries, known scientifically as Rubus fruticosus , are perennial plants that belong to the Rosaceae family. Native to Europe and Asia, blackberry plants are typically thorny shrubs or vines, growing up to 3 meters in height. The leaves of the plant are compound with three to five leaflets arranged alternately on the stem. The flowers are white or pale pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a dark purple or black aggregate of drupelets.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Rubus fruticosus

Common Names: blackberry, bramble (En); zarza (SP); murier (Fr); amora silvestre (Portuguese)

## Uses & Benefits

Blackberries can be consumed fresh or used in culinary applications such as pies, jams, jellies, desserts and wines. They are also processed into juice or dried for use in tea blends. Nutritionally, blackberries offer high levels of antioxidants like anthocyanins which contribute to their deep color. They also provide dietary fiber, Vitamin C and K among other nutrients.

## Varieties of BlackBerry

There exist several varieties of blackberries including trailing (Rubus ursinus), erect (Rubus argutus), semi-erect (Rubus allegheniensis) among others which differ based on size, taste profile and growth habit. Erect blackberries are bushes that support themselves, while the trailing blackberries have long canes that must be trellised for support.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Blackberries prefer well-draining soils with a pH between 5.5-6.5 that is rich in organic matter. They require full sun exposure for optimal growth but can tolerate partial shade. Planting is best done during early spring using either bare-root plants or potted plants which should be spaced about 4-10 feet apart depending on variety.

### Growing from Seed

For semi-erect cultivars, space plants 5 to 6 feet apart. Space erect cultivars 3 feet apart. Space trailing varieties 5 to 8 feet apart. Space rows about 8 feet apart.

General Care & Maintenance

Pruning is essential for maintaining plant health by removing dead wood and thinning out crowded branches to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration. Regular watering is necessary especially during dry periods while mulching helps conserve soil moisture as well as suppress weeds. Harvesting

Blackberries usually ripen over a period of two months with each bush producing several crops per season starting from the second year after planting although full production is reached after three years. Berries should be harvested when they have fully turned dark purple or black which indicates peak sweetness.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose Elsinoe veneta

- Symptoms: Small purple or red circular lesions on canes which enlarge and develop a sunken gray, cracked center; margin of lesions become raised and purple; lesions coalesce to form large discolored areas; canes may eventually be girdled and die back.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters in diseases canes; emergence of disease is favored by prolonged periods of wet weather and excessive overhead irrigation.

- Management: Management Cultural practices for controlling the spread of disease in the home garden include: avoiding excessive applications of nitrogen fertilizers, keeping areas surrounding plants free from weeds, avoiding overhead irrigation and watering only during the day, ensuring the plants have adequate time to dry out in the afternoon; commercial growers may require the use of fungicides for large plantations.

#### Blackberry rosette (Double blossom) Cercosporella rubi

- Symptoms: Flowers with distorted petals and enlarged sepals which gives the appearance of a double flower; unopened flowers are enlarged and redder than normal; shoots may have abnormal proliferations; no fruit is produced on infected branches.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Wild blackberries can act as a reservoir for the disease; flowers of uninfected canes can become infected from those on infected canes and will show symptoms the following year.

- Management: Management The most effective method of controlling the disease is the use of resistant blackberry varieties; if plants are already infected but disease is not yet severe then remove and destroy any abnormal blossom clusters; old canes should be removed and destroyed immediately following harvest; fungicide application may limit damage; disease can also be controlled by only harvesting berries in alternating years, completely destroying the above ground part of the plants in the years in between; the planting may be split in two so that there is a harvest of fruit each year while the other half is cut back.

#### Botrytis fruit rot Botrytis cinerea

- Symptoms: Canes are bleached in appearance and develop flattened masses of black fungal fruiting bodies where grey mycelium and spores develop; flowers may become infected and become blighted by the fungus; infected drupelets on the fruit may develop a watery rot which is replaced by grayish brown fungal structures; if berries are left on the vines they become mummified.

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Emergence of Botrytis fruit rot is favored by cool and wet conditions; physical damage to fruit increases likelihood of infection.

- Management: Management Promote air circulation around vines by using trellises or training the vines; avoid over fertilizing plants; protective fungicides can be used to control the disease and should be applied at intervals of 7-14 days from early bloom right through to harvest.

#### Cane and Leaf Rust Kuehneola uredinis

- Symptoms: The infected plant cane and leaves exhibit the small, lemon-yellow pustules. As the disease progress infected cane will show cracking and drying, whereas the leaves become spotted and dries off.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: It is a non systemic disease.

- Management: Management Prune out and burn infected cane and leaves.

#### Orange rust Gymnoconia peckiana

- Symptoms: New growth is weak and spindly and lacks spines; leaves are stunted and distorted and are pale in color; waxy pustules develop on leaf undersides and turn orange and powdery; infected leaves eventually drop from the plant.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Wild brambles and dewberries may act as a reservoir for the disease; fungus overwinters in the host plant.

- Management: Management Infected plants should be removed in entirety; prune and burn fruiting canes after harvest; improve air circulation around foliage by pruning and trellising vines; spread of rust can be minimized by applying foliar fungicides wen the orange spores are being produced; if well managed, the disease is not usually serious.

#### Powdery mildew Podosphaera macularis

- Symptoms: Light green chlorotic patches on foliage which later develops into powdery gray patches; leaves may be twisted or distorted; if infection is severe then shoots may become spindly with small leaves which cup upwards.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters in buds or on surface of canes; emergence of the disease is favored by warm, dry weather conditions.

- Management: Management If powdery mildew is known to be a problem in a particular area then avoid planting susceptible varieties; varieties bred in the US state of Arkanasas, such as Navaho, Apache, and Arapaho, are known to be quite resistant to powdery mildew.

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Crown gall Agrobacterium tumefaciens

- Symptoms: Galls on canes and branches above ground or on root system; galls have a rough surface and a spongy texture; galls may darken and develop cracks as they mature; galls may have little or no effect on growth but can cause a reduction in vigor and death of plants.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Bacteria most commonly enter the plant through wounds created by pruning or from wind damage; the bacterium causes a proliferation of undifferentiated plant cells which form a gall.

- Management: Management Avoid planting in areas known to have been affected by crown gall for a period of a least three years; if an infected plant is found, destroy it immediately; a biological control agent called Galltron is available for use in blackberries which contains a nonpathogenic strain of Agrobacterium which is antagonistic to the bacterium which causes crown gall; roots of new plantings are dipped in the substance prior to planting to protect them.


# Blueberry

## Description

Blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum, is a crown forming, woody, perennial shrub in the family Ericaceae grown for its fruits, or berries, of the same name. The blueberry plant possesses oval or elliptical leaves which grow alternately on the stems. The stems, or twigs, are yellow/green in color and turn reddish in winter. Flowers are bell shaped and can be either white or pink, occurring in clusters of 8 to 10 flowers. Berries are blue to black in color and 0.6–1.3 cm (0.25–0.5 in) in size. Lowbush blueberry plants (including Vaccinium angustifolium ) are smaller in stature, reaching heights of 35 to 60 cm (13.8–23.6 in) and with proper management can produce fruit for between 40 and 50 years. Lowbush blueberries are also sometimes referred to as Maine, New Hampshire or wild blueberry and are native to eastern/central Canada and northeastern United States. Highbush blueberries (including Vaccinium corymbosum ) are generally 2–3 m (6.6–9.8 ft) in height but can reach up to 5 m (16.4 ft) and may also be referred to as huckleberry or swamp blueberry. Highbush blueberry accounts for most of the commercial production of blueberry fruit and is also native only to North America.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Vaccinium corymbosum

Common Name: arandano (Sp); airelle à corymbes (Fr); Kulturheidelbeere (Germany)

## Uses & Benefits

Blueberries can be eaten fresh or can be dried or baked for further processing. Frozen or pureed berries are commonly used to make jams and preserves and baked goods. Lowbush blueberry is commonly used to make wine. blueberries are an excellent source of dietary fibre, vitamin C, vitamin K, manganese, iron and a number of antioxidants.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Lowbush blueberry grows best in well-drained, acidic soils with a pH between 4.5 and 4.8 and should be planted in early Spring as purchased plants or as “plugs” (a small cutting, including root, from an established bush). The newly planted blueberry should be covered in a couple of inches of mulch to conserve moisture in the soil. Any flowers produced by the plants should be removed for at least one year after planting to promote vigor and new growth.

### Growing from Seed

Highbush blueberry can be propagated from seeds, cuttings from an established plant or bare root and should be planted in late Fall. Blueberry plants grow best in well drained, highly acidic soils with a pH between 4.5 and 5.8. The plants have a shallow root system and should be planted in a hole at least twice as large as the existing root system and mulched with a 7-10 cm (3-4 in) layer of organic mulch.

### General Care and Maintenance

The first year of blossom should be removed to encourage new growth and it is also recommended to do the same in the second year. Plants should be pruned annually, particularly after the first two years, to promote plant vigour and remove diseased or broken canes. Irrigation is recommended due to the shallow root system and greatly promotes the fruit yield this practice is highly recommended if growing commercially.

Plants should be pruned by cutting close to the ground and a pruned plant will not produce any fruit in the first year, but in the second year subsequent to pruning their should be a good yield. Growth can be stimulated by field- burning, as these plants are very fire-tolerant.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Botrytis blossom blight (Gray mold) Botrytis cinerea

- Symptoms: Corollas of expanded blossoms appear blighted; brown lesions on leaves which have come into contact with infected blossoms; infected blossoms do not produce fruit; in large fields, severe infedctions are often visible as brown patches

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Can be very damaging to lowbush blueberries; fungus overwinters in fruits, stems and leaves of plant; disease emergence is favored by wet weather; severe outbreaks can occur after wet periods lasting several days or more

- Management: Management Disease can be controlled by application of appropriate fungicides, if available, at mid-bloom and late bloom stage

#### Mummy berry Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi

- Symptoms: Drooping of new leaves and shoots in Spring; rapid browning of upper surface of affected shoots and leaf midribs and veins; death of infected shoots,leaves and flowers 24-72 hours after appearance of brown discoloration; after initial symptoms in Spring, plants become symptomless until fruit development; infected berries are cream or pink in color and turn tan or gray; berries become shriveled and hard; shriveled skin of fruit breaks down to expose black rind of fungal tissue

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease affects highbush, lowbush and rabbiteye blueberry varieties; bees can aid the transfer of the fungus from infected to healthy flowers

- Management: Management Plant disease-free, dormant plants; remove or bury mummified fruit, if burying fruit cover with at least an inch of soil; application of appropriate foliar fungicides are very effective at controlling the disease in commercial plantations

#### Powdery mildew Erysiphe vaccinii

- Symptoms: White fluffy growth on upper surfaces of leaves or lower leaf surface; leaves may be puckered in appearance; leaves may develop chlorotic spots with red borders; leaves may drop from plant

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence is favored by warm, dry conditions

- Management: Management Plant resistant highbush blueberry varieties; apply appropriate foliar fungicides, if available

#### Shoestring Blueberry shoestring virus (BBSSV)

- Symptoms: Elongated reddish streaks on green stems; purplish red leaves; cupped leaves; leaves may be elongated or strap-like; reddish-purple fruit

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Infected plants do not show symptoms of disease for 4 years or more. During this latent period the virus can be spread to other plants making the removal of visibly infected bushes an ineffective control method; virus is transmitted by aphids

- Management: Management One of the most effective methods of preventing the spread of the virus is to time applications of insecticides to coincide with aphid emergence; the first application is usually made in late May or early June; any equipment used to apply insecticides should be cleaned thoroughly before moving to a new area

#### Stem canker Botryosphaeria corticus

- Symptoms: Initial symptoms appear as red lesions on green stems which become swollen and conical; on rabbiteye blueberry varieties lesions are initially brown sunken spots; in susceptible varieties lesions develop into large swollen cankers with deep cracks after 2-3 years of infection; if the variety is very susceptible the cankers may kill the stem

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Infection occurs in late Spring; spores are spread by wind; at lower temperatures the disease may be limited to small red flecks

- Management: Management The most important method of controlling stem canker is to plant resistant varieties in areas where the disease occurs as fungicides are largely ineffective; no varieties of highbush blueberry are resistant to all strains of the disease; infected wood should not be used for propogation

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Phytophthora root rot Phytophthora cinnamoni

- Symptoms: Yellowing leaves; lack of new growth on plants; highbush varieties become stunted and turn red; rabbit eye varieties may become chlorotic and srop leaves

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Disease emergence is favored by water-logged soils and warm temperatures; disease is spread by movement of contaminated water and soil

- Management: Management The best method of controlling phytophthora root rot is through the use of good cultural practices: plant blueberries in well-draining soils or in raised beds; sanitize all tool sand equipment regularly; avoid transferring soil between sites


# Brazil nut

## Description

Brazil nut, Bertholletia excelsa , is a tropical evergreen in the family Lecythidaceae grown for its edible seeds (nuts). The brazil nut tree is very large with a long straight trunk which is 1–2 m (3.3–6.6 ft) in diameter. The tree only branches in the upper regions and the long branches are covered in large, leathery, oblong shaped leaves which form a spreading canopy. The tree produces large, pale yellow or greenish flowers and a round fruit which is approximately 15 cm (6 in) in diameter. The fruit has a thick hard shell and contains 18 to 24 angular seeds (nuts). The large edible kernel is protected by a thin, woody shell which has a wrinkled appearance. Brazil nut trees can reach a height of 25–56 m (82–184 ft) and can live for well over 500 years. Brazil nut may also be referred to as cream nut or butter nut and originates from the Amazonian rainforest.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Bertholletia excelsa

Common Names: castaña (Sp); noyer de Para (Fr)

## Uses & Benefits

Brazil nuts are eaten fresh or may be used to extract oil for cooking or for use in the manufacture of soaps.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Brazil nut trees grow in areas of tropical rainforests which have a dry period, usually at low altitude. The nuts are harvested almost exclusively from naturally occurring trees although in some parts of the Amazon, plantations are being developed.

### Growing from Seed

Brazil nut seedlings develop in the forest understory and require a gap to emerge in the forest canopy to provide the light required to develop to maturity. Trees will flower after 5 or 6 years and only begin to bear fruit after a period of 10–20 years. Flowering occurs at the beginning of the dry season and the flowers are pollinated by a large species of bee. The fruit takes 15 months to reach maturity and is harvested in the wet season by collecting as soon as it falls from the tree. Trees have been successfully propagated from seed and planted into a plantation. A major obstacle to plantation production of Brazil nut is the difficulty of attracting the correct species of pollinator.

### Harvesting

Brazil nuts are harvested during the rainy season and the fallen fruits are collected from the forest floor. Collection is usually carried out in the morning to reduce the chance of being hit by falling fruits which can cause severe injury. The fruits are hard and must be hacked open with a machete in order to collect the nuts from inside for further processing.

# Broad bean, dry

## Description

Broad bean, Vicia faba , is a leguminous plant in the family Fabaceae primarily grown for its edible beans. Broad bean is a an annual vetch reaching between 0.5–1.8 m (1.6–6 ft) tall. There are often multiple stems originating from the base of the plant and the compound leaves are often broad, oval shaped, and come groups of 6 leaflets to a stem. The flowers are white with purple markings. Between 1 and 4 pods develop from each flower cluster. The beans can be greenish black, brown or black in color. Vicia faba may also be referred to as bell-bean, fava bean or horsebean and originates from the Mediterranean or in South-West Asia.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Vicia faba

## Uses

## Propagation

Basic requirements Broad bean is a cool-season crop and should be grown in early Spring or late summer to avoid high summer temperatures. Broad beans will grow best at soil temperatures between 15.5 and 18.3°C (60–65°F) and will not grow well at temperature below below 4.4°C (40°F) or above 23.8°C (75°F). Broad bean is particularly susceptible to high temperatures during the summer which make the plants unproductive. Broad beans will grow best in a fertile, well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.75 positioned in full sunlight.

Growing from seed

Broad beans should be direct seeded in the garden in Spring as soon as the soil is workable and temperature is above 4.4°C (40°F) with the optimum temperature for germination being between 10 and 21°C (50–70°F). A second planting can be made in early Fall in areas with moderate winters. Seeds should be planted 2.5–5.0 (1–2 in) deep allowing 7.5–15 cm (3–6 in between plants and approximately 0.6 m ( 2 ft) between rows.

General care and maintenance

Broad bean plants are bush-like but can grow quite tall and will benefit from staking to provide some support and keep them from flopping over due to the weight of the pods. Keep soil moist during flowering to ensure optimum pod development and soak ground thoroughly if plants come into flower during a dry spell. As they are legumes, broad beans generally do not require additional fertilization as long as they have sufficient root nodules. Nodulation can be promoted by inoculating seeds with additional Rhizobacteria prior to planting.

### Harvesting

Broad beans are ready to harvest when the pods are fat and full and beginning to droop from the plant due to the weight of the seeds inside. Seeds can be dried either by leaving pods on the plant until they begin to shrivel or by picking and hanging up to dry out.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial brown spot Pseudomonas syringae

- Symptoms: Small, dark brown necrotic spots on leaves which may be surrounded by a zone of yellow tissue; water soaked spots on pods which turn brown and necrotic; pods may twist and distort in area of infection

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Bacterium overwinters in crop residue; disease more severe when foliage is wet for extended periods

- Management: Management Plant only certified seed; rotate crops regularly; remove crop debris from field after harvest

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Chocolate spot Botrytis cinerea Botrytis fabae

- Symptoms: Symptoms of disease can be aggressive or non-aggressive; symptoms on non- aggressive chocolate spot are small red-brown lesions on leaves of the plant which may also be present on stems and pods; under high humidity the disease moves to the aggressive stage and lesions coalesce and become covered in fluffy mycelium; large patches of tissuy can become necrotic and die

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Long periods of high humidity promote the switch from the non-aggressive phase to the aggressive phase; aggressive phase of the disease favors low levels of potassium and phosphorus in the soil and overcrowded plants

- Management: Management Control should be aimed at preventing the aggressive stage of the disease which can be achieved by lowering humidity; use appropriate plant spacings to encourage air circulation around plants; foliar fungicide applications throughout the season will protect the crop from chocolate spot

#### Downy mildew Peronospora viciae

- Symptoms: Yellow-brown blotches on upper surface of leaves; angular patches of fluffy white-gray fungus on lower side of leaves; plant growth may be stunted or distorted and whole plant may die before flowering; plant may produce

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Leaf blight Xanthomonas campestris syn. Xanthomonas axonopodis

- Symptoms: Water-soaked spots on leaves which enlarge and become necrotic; spots may be surrounded by a zone of yellow discoloration; lesions coalesce and give plant a burned appearance; leaves that die remain attached to plant; circular, sunken, red-brown lesion may be present on pods; pod lesions may ooze during humid conditions

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease can be introduced by contaminates seed; bacteria overwinters in crop debris; disease emergence favored by warm temperatures; spread is greatest during humid, wet weather conditions

- Management: Management Plant only certifies seed; plant resistant varieties; treat seeds with an appropriate antibiotic prior to planting to kill off bacteria; spray plants with an appropriate protective copper based fungicide before appearance of symptoms


# Broccoli

## Description

Broccoli, is an herbaceous annual or biennial grown for its edible flower heads which are used as a vegetable. The broccoli plant has a thick green stalk, or stem, which gives rise to thick, leathery, oblong leaves which are gray-blue to green in color. The plant produces large branching green flower heads covered with numerous white or yellow flowers. Broccoli can be annual or biennial depending on the variety and can grow to 1 m (3.3 ft) in height. Broccoli may also be referred to as sprouting broccoli and likely originates from the Mediterranean although the exact location has not been determined.

### Crop details

Scientific name: Brassica oleracea

Common name: Brokoli (Kiswahili)

## Uses

## Propagation

### Basic requirements

Broccoli is a cool season crop which can be grown both in spring and in fall. The plants thrive in cool climates and should be planted for fall in areas with hot summers. Broccoli grows best in moist, fertile soil with a slightly acidic pH between between 6.0 and 7.0 and at temperatures between 15.5 and 18°C (60–65°F). Broccoli has a high nitrogen requirement and due to the reduced activity of soil microbes in late fall and winter, organic matter should be added to the soil throughout the year to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients when broccoli is planted. In addition, broccoli requires regular water, especially during drought, to prevent the plants from going to seed. Plant broccoli in full sun to ensure optimum head size.

Growing from seed

Broccoli can be direct seeded or started indoors for transplants. Spring plantings should be made 2–3 weeks before the last frost date in your area and Fall plantings should be made approximately 100 days before the first Fall frost. Sow seed 1.3 cm (0.5 in) deep in small groups of 2–3 seeds and about a week after emergence, thin to a final spacing of 30–60 cm (12–24 in) within the row, allowing 90 cm (36 in) between rows. Keep soil evenly moist after planting. If starting indoors, plant seed in peat pots to minimize disturbance to the roots when transplanting. Seedling can be planted outdoors when they are 3–4 weeks old at the same time as seeds are planted using the spacing detailed above. Plant transplants slightly deeper in the ground than they currently are in their pot and keep soil moist to ensure good fertility.

General care and maintenance

Broccoli has a very shallow root system and cultivating the soil around the plants to remove weeds should be avoided. Provide the plants with adequate and even moisture (about 2 in a week) to keep plants fertile and prevent them from bolting and avoid wetting the flower heads as they develop. Mulching around the plants helps to conserve soil moisture and reduces the soil temperature.

### Harvesting

Broccoli is ready to harvest when the flower buds are firm and packed tightly in the head. Harvest before the buds open by cutting the stalk of the head at a 45° angle about 13–20 cm (5–8 in) below the head. Side-shoots will continue to produce after the first harvest.

# Brussels sprouts

## Description

Brussel sprouts, Brassica oleracea, are a cultivar of cabbage in the family Brassicaceae grown for their edible small leafy green buds, which resemble miniature cabbages.  The plant has long, smooth and leathery leaves which can be green to purple in color and are arranged alternately on the stem. The sprouts form at the base of each leaf, in a long, spiral stem. The edible portion of the crop is the bud, which is a small cabbage-like head. It is a light green to green/blue in color. The plant is biennial but grown as an annual and can reach 0.6–1 m (2–3 ft) in height with a spread of 0.5–0.6 m (1.5–2 ft).  Brussel sprouts may also be simply referred to as 'sprouts' and they originated from Northern Europe.

## Uses

Brussel sprouts are most commonly eaten cooked as a vegetable.  They may also be pickled in vinegar.Basic requirements

Brussels sprouts are a cool season crop which can be grown both in Spring and in Fall. The plants thrive in cool climates, maturing in cool or lightly frosty weather. In areas with hot summers, they should be planted for a Fall harvest. Brussels sprouts grow best in moist, fertile, well-draining soil with a slightly acidic pH between between 6.0 and 6.5 and at temperatures between 7 and 24°C (45–75°F), with optimum growth occurring at 15–18°C (59–64°F). Brussels sprouts have a high nitrogen requirement and due to the reduced activity of soil microbes in late fall and winter, organic matter should be added to the soil throughout the year to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients when sprouts are planted. Plant Brussels sprouts in an area that receives at least six hours of full sunlight for optimum growth and development.

Growing from seed

Brussels sprouts can be direct seeded or started indoors for transplants. Spring plantings should be made 2–3 weeks before the last frost date in your area and Fall plantings should be made approximately 4 months before the first Fall frost. Sow seed 1.3 cm (0.5 in) deep in small groups of 2–3 seeds and about a week after emergence, thin to a final spacing of 60 cm (24 in) within the row, allowing 76 cm (30 in) between rows. Keep soil evenly moist after planting. If starting indoors, plant seed in peat pots to minimize disturbance to the roots when transplanting. Seedling can be planted outdoors when they are 3–4 weeks old at the same time as seeds are planted using the spacing detailed above. Plant transplants slightly deeper in the ground than they currently are in their pot and keep soil moist to ensure good fertility.

General care and maintenance

Brussels sprouts are sensitive to boron deficiency which can cause the plants to develop hollow stems and small buds. The deficiency can be corrected by adding boron to the soil. Brussels sprouts should be provided with adequate and even moisture (1.0 to 1.5 inches a week) to keep plants fertile and prevent them from bolting. Mulching around the plants helps to conserve soil moisture and reduces the soil temperature.

### Harvesting

Brussels sprouts are generally ready for harvest 90 to 180 days after planting when the heads are firm and green and have reached between 2.5 and 5.0 cm (1–2 in) in diameter. The oldest sprouts are located at the bottom of the stalk and mature upwards. As sprouts are removed, it can be beneficial to remove the leaves which are beginning to yellow. Some people prefer to remove all of the leaves on the stalk to accelerate maturity and harvest in a manner similar to commercial sprout production. The stalks can be removed before the ground freezes over and stored indoors for further harvesting.

# Buckwheat

## Description

Buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, is an herbaceous annual plant in the family Polygonaceae grown for its seeds which can be utilized in a manner similar to wheat or oats.  The buckwheat plant is a fast growing, spindly, broad leaf plant with small heart-shaped leaves and hollow stems.   The plant produces many small white or pink flowers which, when pollinated, quickly produce seeds. The seeds are triangular in shape and change from light green in color, to red-brown. The seed consists of a true seed (groat) which is surrounded by a thick hull.  Buckwheat plants can grow between 40 and 120 cm (15.7-47.2 in) in height and survive for just one growing season.  Buckwheat may also be referred to as qiaomei or ogal and was likely first domesticated from a wild ancestor in China.

## Uses

Buckwheat can be used in the production of many foods in place of wheat e.g., pancakes, cakes and biscuits. It is also commonly used in breakfast cereals or it may also be blended into flour.  The grain may also be used as fodder for animals.  Buckwheat is an excellent cover crop, taking only 4–5 weeks from seed to flower and can protect against soil erosion and invasion by weeds.Basic requirements

Buckwheat grows optimally in temperate or sub-tropical climates where the temperatures are between 15–25°C but it may also be grown successfully in more tropical climates at higher elevation. Buckwheat will be killed by frost. In addition, the plants require a period of dry weather for harvest. Buckwheat can be grown in poor soils but will produce optimally in well-draining loamy soil. The plants will tolerate a wide pH range from 4.5 down to 7.0. It is a short-season crop and therefore does well when planted in the fall, stimulated by shorter day length.

Growing from seed

Buckwheat is grown by direct seeding and the seedbed should be properly prepared in advance of sowing. The soil should be fine but firm and dug to a depth of approximately 5 cm (2.0 cm) to aid in seedling emergence. Commercial fields are sown by mechanical drilling in rows spaced approximately 30 cm (12 in) apart but can simply be sown simply by broadcasting in the home garden. Seed should be scattered at a rate of about one pound of seed per 500 square feet of soil.

General care and maintenance

Buckwheat can be grown in nutrient poor soils and it does not require the addition of fertilizer. If growing buckwheat as a cover crop it should be mowed down within 2 weeks of flowering to prevent the plants setting seed. The plant debris can be turned under the soil to decompose as green manure. Allow a few weeks between mowing and planting any new crops to allow the plant matter to decompose.

# Cabbage (red, white, Savoy)

## Description

Cabbage is a leafy vegetable with a round, compact head or "heart" made up of many layers of thick, sturdy leaves that grow in a tightly packed formation. The outer leaves are usually a darker green, while the inner leaves are lighter in color. The leaves have a smooth, slightly waxy texture and a slightly bitter taste. The densely leafed heads can range in size from 0.5 to 3.6 kg (1–8 lb) depending on variety. Cabbage typically ranges in size from small to large, with smaller heads being more tender and sweeter. The vegetable can also come in different colors, including green, purple, and white, depending on the variety. When cooked, cabbage softens and becomes more tender, but it still retains its distinctive taste and texture.

Cabbage has its roots in the Mediterranean region, but today it is grown in many other countries as well. China is currently the largest producer of cabbage, accounting for more than half of the world's production. Other top producers include India, Russia, and South Korea.

Some of the top cabbage-producing countries in Africa include Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. In Ethiopia, cabbage is one of the most widely grown vegetables and is an important crop for small-scale farmers. In Tanzania, the crop is grown in the highlands and is an important source of income for farmers. Kenya is also a major producer, with the crop being grown in areas such as Kiambu and Nyandarua counties. In South Africa, cabbage is grown in several regions, including Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and the Western Cape.

They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and are believed to have anti- inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In cooking, cabbages can be boiled, steamed, roasted, or sautéed, and are a popular ingredient in soups, stews, stir-fries, salads, and slaws. Fermented cabbages, such as sauerkraut, are a traditional and nutritious food, while cabbage juice may be used topically for skin health. Additionally, cabbages can be used as animal feed or for decorative purposes.

## Varieties

There are many different varieties of cabbage. The main varieties are white and red cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) and savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. Sabauda).

Red cabbage has a deep purple-red color and a slightly sweeter flavor than green cabbage, while savoy has crinkly, curly leaves that are a darker shade of green than green cabbage.

There are many other different varieties of cabbage, each with its own unique characteristics:

Green cabbage: This variety has a tight head of crisp, green leaves.

Red cabbage: This variety has a deep purple-red color and a slightly sweeter flavor than green cabbage.

Napa cabbage: Also known as Chinese cabbage, this variety has long, oblong leaves and a milder flavor than other types of cabbage.

Bok choy: A type of Chinese cabbage with white stalks and dark green leaves, often used in stir-fries.

Brussels sprouts: While technically not a variety of cabbage, Brussels sprouts are a close relative. They grow on a stalk and have small, round heads of tightly packed leaves.

Conehead cabbage: This variety has a pointed head and pale green leaves.

January King cabbage: This variety has a greenish-blue color and is known for its sweet and nutty flavor.

Pointed cabbage: This variety has a pointed head and is similar in flavor to green cabbage.

Stonehead cabbage: This variety has a small, tight head and is very dense and heavy.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Cabbage is a cool-season crop that requires specific climatic, soil, and water conditions to grow successfully, as described below.

Climatic Conditions: The crop prefers cool and moist conditions, with an average temperature range of 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 18 degrees Celsius). Temperatures above 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) can cause the cabbage heads to bolt, which means they will prematurely form seed stalks instead of edible heads. Cabbage requires at least six hours of sunlight per day and does well in regions with a long growing season.

Soil Conditions: Cabbage grows well in well-drained soils that are rich in organic matter. The soil should be loose, fertile, and have a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. The soil should be well-aerated and have a good water-holding capacity, allowing water to infiltrate and drain easily. Adding compost or other organic matter to the soil before planting can help improve its structure and fertility.

Water Conditions: The crop requires regular watering, especially during the early stages of growth. The optimal amount of water for cabbages is around 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) per week, either from rainfall or irrigation. Soil moisture should be monitored closely to prevent either underwatering or overwatering, as either condition can cause problems with growth, yield, and disease susceptibility.

### Growing from Seed

To maximize yield and produce healthy and flavorful cabbages, the following steps should be followed when planting cabbages:

Seed selection: Choose high-quality cabbage seeds from a reputable seed supplier. There are many different varieties of cabbage, each with different growing requirements and mature sizes. Select a variety that suits your growing conditions and preferences.

Seed starting: Cabbage seeds can be started indoors or directly sown in the garden. If starting indoors, sow the seeds in a seed tray or container with a good-quality seed-starting mix. Keep the soil consistently moist and maintain a temperature of around 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). Seeds typically germinate within 7 to 10 days.

Transplanting: When the seedlings have grown to about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters) tall, they can be transplanted into the garden. Cabbage should be planted at a spacing of 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 centimeters) apart, with rows spaced 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 centimeters) apart.

Planting: Plant the seedlings in a hole slightly deeper than their root ball and gently firm the soil around them. Water the soil well after planting to help settle it.

### General Care and Maintenance

Cabbage requires consistent moisture, so water regularly to prevent the soil from drying out. Fertilize the plants every two weeks with a balanced fertilizer high in nitrogen. Cabbage plants are also prone to pests and diseases, so monitor the plants regularly for signs of damage or stress and take appropriate measures to control any issues.

### Harvesting

Harvesting cabbages is an important task in vegetable farming. Cabbage is typically grown for its dense, leafy heads that are used in a variety of culinary dishes. When it's time to harvest, farmers carefully inspect each head of cabbage to determine if it's ready to be picked. They look for the firmness and tightness of the head as well as the size and color of the leaves. Once a cabbage head is deemed ready for harvest, the farmer uses a sharp knife to cut it off at the base. It's important to be careful during this process to avoid damaging the plant or other nearby cabbages. After harvesting, the cabbages are washed and stored in a cool, dry place until they're ready to be sold or used. Overall, harvesting cabbages requires attention to detail and a steady hand, but the end result is a delicious and nutritious vegetable that can be enjoyed in a variety of dishes.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Alternaria leaf spot (Black spot, Gray spot) Alternaria brassicae

- Symptoms: Small dark spots on leaves which turn brown to gray; lesions may be round or angular and may possess a purple-black margin; lesions may form concentric rings, become brittle and crack in center; dark brown elongated lesions may develop on stems and petioles.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: May become a problem on cabbage during cool, wet periods.

- Management: Management Plant only pathogen-free seed; rotate crops; applications of appropriate fungicides control disease when present.

#### Anthracnose Colletotrichum higginsianum

- Symptoms: Small circular or irregularly shaped dry spots which are gray to straw in color on leaves; a high number of spots may cause the leaf to die; lesions may coalesce to form large necrotic patches causing leaves to turn yellow and wilt; lesions may split or crack in dry centers.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters on leaf debris and on related weeds; disease emergence is favored by moist, warm conditions.

- Management: Management Control of disease depends on sanitary practices; treat seeds with hot water prior to planting; rotate crops; plant in an area with good soil drainage; remove all cruciferous weeds which may act as a reservoir for the fungus.

#### Black rot Xanthomonas campestris

- Symptoms: Irregularly shaped dull yellow areas along leaf margins which expand to leaf midrib and create a characterstic "V-shaped" lesion; lesions may coalesce along the leaf margin to give plant a scorched appearance.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Pathogen is spread via infected seed or by splashing water and insect movement; disease emergence favored by warm and humid conditions.

- Management: Management Primary method of controlling black rot is through the use of good sanitation practices; rotate crops to non-cruciferous crops every 2 years; plant resistant varieties; control cruciferous weed species which may act as a reservoir for bacteria; plant pathogen-free seed.

- Management: Management Practice good garden sanitation by removing garden trash, weeds and plant debris to promote good air circulation and reduce moist habitat for slugs and snails; handpick slugs at night to decrease population; spread wood ashes or eggshells around plants; attract molluscs by leaving out organic matter such as lettuce or grapefruit skins, destroy any found feeding on lure; sink shallow dishes filled with beer into the soil to attract and drown the molluscs; chemical controls include ferrous phosphate for organic gardens and metaldehyde (e.g. Buggeta) and carbaryl (e.g Sevin bait) for non-organic growers


# Cantaloupe

## Description

Cantaloupe, Cucumis melo, is a vining plant in the family Cucurbitaceae, grown for its large, sweet fruit of the same name.  Cantaloupe vines are trailing and are slightly hairy with simple oval leaves arranged alternately on the stem.  The plant produces small yellow flowers which are 1.2–3.0 cm (0.5–1.2 in) in diameter and large oval to round fruit with green to orange flesh.  Melon is an annual plant and a vine can grow up to 3 m (9.8 ft) in length.  Cantaloupe may be referred to as muskmelon or melon and likely originate from East and Northeast Africa.

## Uses

Melon is primarily consumed as a fresh fruit. The pulp may be turned into a fresh beverage and the seeds can be roasted and eaten.The unripe fruit of some species are cooked as a vegetable.Basic requirements

Cantaloupe is a warm-season crop, requiring lots of sun and good drainage to develop optimally and growing best at temperatures between 18 and 28°C (65–82°F). Melon will yield best if grown in a light, well-draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Cantaloupe should be planted in full sun and are heavy feeders and water users. They need to be provided with ample soil moisture and fertilized regularly. Vining varieties can grow to very large sizes and require a good deal of space.

Growing froom seed

Cantaloupe can be direct seeded in areas with a long, warm growing season but in more Northern climates it should be sown indoors and transplanted. If direct seeding,seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 18.4°C (65°F). Allow 90–120 cm (~3–4 ft) between seeds in a row and 150–180 cm (~5–6 ft) between rows. If transplanting, seeds should be sown approximately 3–4 weeks before the last frost date in your area and transplanted after the plants develop their first set of true leaves. Seeds sown both indoors and out require lightly moist soil for germination, care should be taken to avoid overwatering as seeds are prone to rotting. Seeds should germinate in 3–10 days depending on the soil temperature.

### Transplanting

Cantaloupe seedlings should be transplanted when all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed to at least 18.4°C (65°F). Covering soil with dark plastic or mulch a week prior to planting outdoors can help bring the soil temperature up more quickly in colder regions, allowing earlier planting. Beginning approximately 7–10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/264). The planting site should be prepared by incorporating plenty of organic matter to encourage vegetative growth. When transplanting seedlings, allow 90–120 cm (~3–4 ft) between plants and 150–180 cm (~5–6 ft) between rows. Drip or soaker irrigation is preferred to overhead irrigation and plants should be watered evenly to keep them moist.

General care and maintenance

Cantaloupe vines are sprawling and require plenty space to grow. Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence to save space. Cantaloupe plants also require a regular supply of water while growing, blooming and setting fruit and where drip irrigation is not being used, plants should be watered deeply once per week, providing at least an inch of water. Mulches can be used to conserve soil moisture and black polyethylene mulch has the advantage of warming the soil.

### Harvesting

Cantaloupes are ready to be harvested when the the surface becomes netted and the color underneath turns from green to yellow. When the melon is ready to picked the stem will come away easily from the fruit.

# Cardamom

## Description

Cardamom, Elletaria cardamomum, is an herbaceous perennial in the family Zingiberaceae grown for its fruits which are used as a spice. Cardamom is a clumping plant with between 10 and 20 leafy shoots arising from the rhizome. The shoots are actually pseudostems composed of overlapping leaf sheaths. There are several additional flowering shoots. The leaves are lanceolate and dark green in color. The plant produces flowers on a long drooping pannicle and a capsule-like fruit which is triangular in cross section and initially pale green or yellow in color but dries to brown. The fruit contains 15–20 small aromatic seeds. Cardamom can reach a height of 5 m (16.4 ft) and has an economic lifespan of 10-15 years. Cardamom may also be referred to as green cardamom, black cardamom, brown cardamom, red cardamom or white cardamom and originates from southern India and Sri Lanka.

## Uses

The cardamom fruit or seeds are used dried as a culinary spice. The seeds are used whole or ground. Cardamom may also be used as a flavoring in drinks, baked goods and confection.Basic requirements

Cardamom originates from mountainous forests and can be grown in a variety of soils ranging from forest loam to quartz gravels. It can be grown in the home garden in areas with tropical climates and elsewhere can be grown as a container plant and moved indoors when the temperature drops in the Fall. The optimum annual mean temperature for the growth of the plant is 22°C (71.6°F) and the plant will not grow below 17°C (62.6°F). As a consequence of their forest origins, cardamom plants thrive in shaded areas with indirect sunlight.

## Propagation

Cardamom seeds can be collected from the mature capsules (pods) by gently pressing the capsules until they pop open. The seeds should be left to dry for a couple of days before planting in a container or outdoors in a prepared bed. For large scale production, they are commonly sown in nursery beds and transplanted to the field when they are 1–2 years old.  Propagation from rhizomes is achieved by dividing the rhizome of plants that have at least three shoots. Plants are usually spaced 1.5–3 m (5–10 ft) apart allowing a further 1.5–3 m (5–10 ft) between rows.

# Carrot

## Description

Carrot, Daucus carota, is an edible, biennial herb in the family Apiaceae grown for its edible root. The carrot plant produces a rosette of 8–12 leaves above ground and a fleshy conical taproot below ground.  The plant produces  small (2 mm) flowers which are white, red or purple in color. The root can grow to between 5 and 50 cm (2.0–20 in) long and reach 5 cm (2.0 in) in diameter.  The foliage of the plant can reach a height of 150 cm (59.1 in) when in flower.  The carrot plant can be annual or biennial and may also be referred to as  wild carrot.  The plant is believed to have originated in Europe or the Western Mediterranean.

## Uses

Carrot roots are eaten as a vegetable and can be consumed fresh or cooked. Carrot juice is consumed as a beverage. The leaves of the plant can be used as feed for animals.Basic requirements

Carrots are cool-season crops which can be planted in early Spring and left in the ground all summer for harvest in the fall. Carrots grow best in a well-draining, loose, sandy soil which is free of large rocks and has a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. They require full sun for optimum development but will tolerate some very light shade. The optimum temperature for their growth is between 16 and 24°C (61–74°F). Carrot seedlings are very sensitive to extremes of temperature, very hot weather may kill the plant whereas temperatures below 10°C (50°F) tend to cause the development of longer, paler roots. The plants also require plenty moisture and organic matter. Carrots do very well in raised beds and can also be grown in containers.

### Sowing seeds

Carrot is usually direct seeded and should be planted 3–5 weeks before the least frost date in your area. Soil should be prepared prior to planting by removing rocks and breaking up any hard lumps of soil down to a depth of at least 30 cm (12 in). It is also beneficial to work some compost into the soil prior to planting. Avoid using fresh manure as it can cause forking of the roots. Sow seeds 6 mm (0.25 in) deep, leaving 5 cm (2 in) between seeds and approximately 30 cm (1 ft) apart. When seedlings reach 2.5 cm (1 in) in height, thin them to a final spacing of 7.5 cm (3 in) between plants by snipping with scissors - this avoids damaging plant roots.

General care and maintenance

Carrots benefit from a plentiful moisture supply and should be provided with 2.5 cm (1 in) of water each week. Mulching around the plants helps to conserve moisture and reduce weeds. Any weeds growing around the plants should be carefully removed. The plants should be fertilized 5–6 weeks after the seeds are sown.

### Harvesting

Carrots are generally ready to harvest after around 2–3 months when the roots have reached 1.3 cm (0.5 in) in diameter. Allowing the carrots to stay in the ground for at least one frost makes them sweeter but care should be taken to harvest before the ground freezes or to cover the plants to prevent freezing. Carrots are harvested by gently digging around the plant to expose the top of the root and gently, but firmly pulling the root from the soil by grasping the top of the carrot just above the root. Carrot tops should be twisted off and the roots washed prior to refrigeration in airtight bags. Carrots may also be stored in moist sand to keep them fresh prior to use.

# Cashew nuts

## Description

Cashew is an evergreen tree with deep tap roots, grown for its edible fruits (nuts). The cashew tree has a branching main trunk and characteristic domed crown. The thin foliage of the tree is limited to the ends of the branches and is made up of oval-oblong leathery, shiny dark green leaves.

The leaves are smooth with pronounced veins and midrib and possess petioles that are swollen at their base. The tree produces numerous pinkish-white flowers on drooping panicles and a kidney-shaped true fruit (nut) which is approximately 3 cm (1.2 in) long with a grey-brown shell and develops from a fleshy accessory fruit, sometimes referred to as the 'cashew apple'. The cashew apple is pear-shaped and red to yellow.

Cashew trees can reach a height of 12 m (39.4 ft) and have an economic lifespan of 25 years after which time they are replaced in commercial plantations.

Cashew originates from Brazil. The Portuguese introduced cashew to Mozambique in the 16th century where it flourished, forming extensive forests; eventually, it also became dispersed in East Africa along the coastal plains of Kenya and Tanzania.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Anacardium occidentale

Common Names: Mkorosho / mkanju (Swahili)

## Uses & Benefits

The kernels or nuts have a high nutritional as well as commercial value and are used for human consumption either raw or roasted. The cashew nut apple is rich in Vitamin C (about 5 times higher than the orange) and is used for the production of juice, wines, spirits, jam, pickles, and chutneys. The liquid of the shell is used for brake linings, heatproof and waterproof paints, and protective varnishes. Cashew nut wood is of poor quality but can be used as firewood if mixed with other types of wood.

## Varieties

Recommended varieties of cashew nuts by KALRO are A75/83, A100, A81, and A82.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Cashew trees are usually grown at altitudes of between 0-500 m above sea level (asl) but can grow up to 1000 m asl. They can be very drought resistant provided their roots penetrate deeply into the soil and draw water from the subsoil. For mature trees 500 mm of rainfall per year is adequate, but seedlings should be watered until properly established. If rainfall is below 900 mm per year plant at the widest spacing indicated. Cashew nut trees tolerate a wide range of soils provided they are deep and well-drained. They can grow quite well on infertile soils but do not do well on coral outcrops at the coast.

### Growing from Seed

Cashew nuts are usually propagated through seed or grafted seedlings. In propagation by direct seeding 3 seeds are planted in the planting hole and two months after germination the weak seedlings are uprooted leaving the strong ones to grow.

The holes should be 60 cm by 60cm so that they can be able to collect water during the rainy season which will be used during the dry season.

Cashew trees are generally planted with a spacing of 7.5 m X 7.5 m (175 plants/ ha) or 8 m X 8 m (156 plants/ ha) is recommended. High-density planting of cashew at a closer spacing of 4 m X 4 m (625 plants/ ha) in the beginning and thinning out in stages to maintain a final spacing of 8 m X 8 m in the tenth year is also recommended.

Proper seed selection from healthy, high-yielding trees is important, and it can be done by sorting out seeds by the water density method:

Intercropping can be done before the canopies close. Most annual crops can be used apart from cotton and sweet potatoes, which are host plants for Helopeltis bugs, major pests of cashew. Do not interplant young trees with pasture because of the high competition for water during the dry season.

Planting using grafted seedlings

Propagation through grafting starts by raising rootstock propagated from local cashew nut varieties. The first step is a visual selection of seeds to remove diseased or deformed seeds. The selected seeds are taken through a flotation test in water. Seeds that sink are planted in pre-germination beds.

The pre-germinated seeds are transplanted into potting bags when the radicals (tap root) are 2.5 –3cm after 7-10 days. The recommended soil media for cashew nut seedlings is in the ratio of 2:1:150 where: 2 is two buckets of soil, 1 is one bucket of well-decomposed farmyard manure, and 150gms of DAP. The seedlings are transplanted in potting bags (6" x 9"). This composition can sustain the plant for an average of three months after transplanting the pre- germinated seeds in them.

Seedlings are ready for grafting when they attain more than two functional leaves and the cotyledons are still attached to the young stem. Grafting is done 3-4 weeks after transplanting into potting bags.

Scions for grafting are harvested from select mother plants. The following procedure for grafting is recommended:

a. Cut and remove the actively growing part of the rootstock, leaving two functional leaves.

b. Vertically cut down the stock between the two leaves to a depth of 2.5 – 3.0cm.

c. Make a wedge cut of the scion of a similar length of 2.5-3.0 cm and sharpen it.

d. Insert the scion into the rootstock and tie them together.

e. Cover the scion and the rootstock by wrapping them with grafting tape.

f. Wait for 2-3 weeks and unwrap the scion.

### General Care and Maintenance

No fertilizer is required, but well-rotted manure at planting is beneficial. The area around the tree should be 1 ½ times the size of the canopy and should be kept clean of weeds for the first 2 years to avoid competition.

If planted on a slope the tree should have a U-shaped mound of soil below it to collect rainwater for improved growth. Seeds germinate within 2-4 weeks. Thin after 3-4 months leaving only the strongest plant at each site.

Mulching with black polythene is beneficial to increase the growth and yield of cashew. However, locally available materials like green or dry grass or weeds can be utilized for mulching the basins. Small pebbles or stones can also be used for mulching the basin.

Plastic or stone mulch does not improve soil health but ensures better moisture retention in the soil and also prevents the attack of soil-borne insects and pests.

The topsoil and sub-soil are kept separately and allowed to wither under the sun. It helps in the migration of termites and ants(this is in the planting process).

Weeding with light digging should preferably be done before the end of the rainy season. Hoeing, cutting the weeds off underground is more effective than slashing.

Cashew plants start bearing after three years of planting and reach full bearing during the tenth year and continue giving remunerative yields for another 20 years(so they can yield up to 45 years after being planted).

Protect seedlings from monkeys, rodents, and bucks by placing wire cages or thorns around the seedlings. Support plants with a stick and trim off side shoots up to 60-90 cm from ground level. When trees are mature, prune dead wood or any borer-damaged or intergrowing branches to give the canopy air and light.

### Harvesting

Cashew nuts planted using seeds begin bearing 3 to 4 years after transplanting the seedlings. The nuts should be harvested as soon as possible, especially under wet conditions, and should be dried before storage.

Grafted seedlings begin bearing within 2 years of transplanting. Depending on the age and maturity of the plant, a tree yields between 10 to 100 kilograms of unshelled nuts per year. One hectare can thus produce between 2,000 to 5,000 kilograms of unshelled nuts per year. Although trees are produced for 40 to 50 years, commercial harvesting is for 35 years.

The cashew nuts do not mature at the same time. The duration of harvest extends from 45-75 days and the nuts should be collected daily during this period. November to May is the harvesting period, with the peak harvest period from November to January. The nuts are collected at weekly intervals from the farm during the harvesting season. During that period the land should be clean to facilitate the collection of cashew. To get good quality nuts, clear the area beneath the tree, collect fallen fruits, detach the nut from the apple, and dry the nuts under the sun for about 2 hours.

The nuts can be graded into Fair Average Quality (FAQ) and Under Grade (UG). FAQ are well-matured nuts and they should be full and well-dried (12% moisture content). The color should be grey or pale brown. They should neither be wrinkled nor spotted.

UG are well-dried and mature nuts. They can be spotted but not wrinkled.

# Cassava (manioc)

## Description

Cassava, Manihot esculenta , is a perennial shrub in the family Euphorbiaceae grown primarily for its storage roots which are eaten as a vegetable. The cassava plant is a woody plant with erect stems and spirally arranged simple lobed leaves with petioles (leaf stems) up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces petal-less flowers on a raceme. The edible roots of the plant are usually cylindrical and tapered and are white, brown or reddish in color. Cassava plants can reach 4 m in height and is usually harvested 9-12 months after planting. Cassava may also be referred to as Brazilian arrowroot, manioc, yuca or tapioca and the origins of the plant are unknown. The plant is not known to occur wild but may have first been cultivated in Brazil. Cassava is the third-largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics, after rice and maize. It is a major staple food in the developing world, providing a basic diet for over half a billion people. It is one of the most drought- tolerant crops, capable of growing on marginal soils.

## Uses

Cassava root is eaten as a vegetable and is considered to be toxic in raw form which is why it must be cooked before being consumed. The root has a variety of applications, some of which include the production of flour, starch, or ethanol. Cassava leaves can supply a good source of vitamins and protein which can also be consumed after cooking. Cassava hay is used as animal feed and it plays a role in the production of adhesives, textiles, and cosmetics.

- Cause: Virus

### Virus

- Comments: Histroy and origin: Disease is prevalent in East Africa (Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya). It was first reported in 1930's in Tanzania and become endemic in later years. It is currently travelling from East Africa westwards and has been reported in the DRC. There is considerable concern that it will appear in the major West African growing regions, notably Nigeria. The virus is transmitted through whiteflies and stem cuttings. The origin of CBSD is suspected to have arisen from the viruses that are already present on the indigenous African flora. Virus structure and properties: The microscopic studies revealed that the virus is 650 nm long and earlier it was believe to be carlavirus. But further studies associate the virus to Ipomovirus. Cassva Brown Streak Disease is caused by two distinct species of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV), belonging to the genus Ipomovirus of the family Potyviridae. Economic loss: Cassava is an important stable crop in Africa and the continent produces an estimated 54% of the world's cassava production. As such the threat from CBSD seems inevitable due to its presence in many eastern African countries and its rate of transmission westwards to the major growing regions in Nigeria (which produced 30.8% of the world's supply). Though the economic loss from brown streak virus depends on region, cultivars and environment conditions, in general it is estimated up to 70% yield loss in susceptible variety is common with losses as high as 100% being observed in some regions. If the disease is unchecked it may cause 2 billion dollar in loss in Nigeria alone and lead to increase widespread poverty and malnutrition in West and Central Africa.

- Management: Management Disease diagnosis: The first and foremost important aspect is to identify the disease correctly. Cassava brown streak disease varies in symptoms which made it difficult to identify in the field. It makes further complicated if both cassava brown streak and cassava mosaic diseases occur together. There are few techniques like serological and molecular methods are used to identify the virus in laboratory but have their limitations. Planting materials: Use only healthy and disease free cuttings for planting. Resistant cultivars: Plant cassava varieties that are more tolerant of brown streak virus such as Garukunsubire and Seruruseke. Roguing and sanitation: Remove and destroy any plants which are symptomatic of the disease including alternative hosts. Early Harvesting of tubers: Harvest crop early to avoid severe losses due to necrosis of tubers. Follow proper plant quarantine practices to avoid spread of virus to new region. Control insect vector: Whiteflies can be controlled by encouraging beneficial insects in the field like spiders, ladybird beetles etc. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor infestation of whiteflies. Spraying insecticidal soaps under leaf surface to kill flies.

### Virus

- Comments: Disease is spread by infected cuttings and by whiteflies. The leaves are yellow, mottled and distorted. If leaves are yellow all over but are a normal size or there brown leaves that that does not indicate disease. Wild cassava (kisamvu cha mpira in Kiswahili) also hosts the disease. The disease was first observed in the late 19th Century in what is now Tanzania. It was not until work in 1938 that the disease transmission was confirmed to occur via grafting as well as vectored by the White fly.

- Management: Management Varieties of cassava resistant to the virus are available in many countries, most traditional varieties of cassava grown in Africa are susceptible to the virus, seek advice from an agricultural extension on suitable varieties for your region (see below). Do not plant cuttings from plants with symptoms of disease; inspect plants regularly for symptoms of disease and remove and destroy any showing symptoms. Infected plants should be uprooted ('rouged'). Replace with disease resistant varieties such as 'Rwizihiza', 'Ndamirabana', 'Cyizere', 'Seruruseke', 'Mavoka', 'Garukunsubire' and 'Mbakungahaze'. There is no agrochemical agent or organic treatment for this disease. There are both control strategies for the whitefly vector.

# Cauliflower

## Description

Cauliflower, Brassica oleracea var. botrytis, is an herbaceous annual or biennial vegetable plant in the family Brassicaceae grown for its edible head. The head is actually a mass of abortive flowers (flowers which are unable to produce fruit or seed as they possess only female reproductive organs; the male organs are either underdeveloped or totally lacking).  Cauliflower plants are shallow rooted with a small, thickened stem. The ribbed leaves branch off the top of the stem and are light green in color. The plant can reach a height of 1–1.5 m (3.3–4.9 ft) and is most commonly grown as an annual, harvested between 60 and 100 days after planting.  The origin of cauliflower has not been definitively determined but its ancestor, wild cabbage, is thought to have originated in ancient Asia Minor.

## Uses

Cauliflower is grown for consumption as a vegetable, either fresh or cooked.  May be processed for freezing or pickling.Basic requirements

Cauliflower is a cool season crop and grows best in well draining, organic soil at a pH of 6.5 or above. A high amount of organic matter in the soil will help to hold moisture. The plant requires consistent cool temperatures to prevent ‘buttoning’ - the formation of several small heads instead of one large one. Cauliflower is less cold hardy than its relatives and it should be planted after the last frost as sub-freezing temperatures are likely to damage the plant. It is best grown as a Fall crop in cooler areas. Only mature plants will survive frost in the Fall.

### Transplants

Cauliflower is most successfully grown from transplants started in the glasshouse or indoors. Peat pots work well for growing seedlings as damage to the roots during transplanting can be avoided. Plant seeds in a sterile seed starting mix to a depth of 0.6-1.3 cm (0.25-0.5 in) deep and keep moist. Seedlings can be transplanted when they are approximately 6 weeks old after hardening. Plant spacing will greatly affect the final size of the cauliflower head and the plants should be spaced at least 46 cm (18 in) apart leaving approximately 75 cm (30 in) between rows.

General care and maintenance

Cauliflower requires consistent moisture during the growing season in order to produce large, tender heads. Do not let the soil dry out. The plants also require ample nitrogen and this should b applied as a side-dressing of fertilizer about half way through the growing season. Cauliflower heads can be discolored by sunlight and when the cauliflower head has reached 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in) the plant requires 'blanching', a process that ensures that the head remains white. This is achieved by gathering the longest outer leaves together at the head and tying them with twine. Remove the twine periodically to check on the progress of the head, check for pests and to allow the head to dry out after rain. Self blanching varieties are available which grow leaves which naturally cover the head.

### Harvesting

Cauliflower heads are ready for harvest when the head reaches 15 to 20 cm in diameter (6-8 in), usually about 7 to 12 days after blanching begins. Harvest the head by cutting the main stem with a sharp knife, including some of the central leaves which will protect the head. The heads can quickly become overmature, leading to reduced quality. Be sure to harvest the heads while they are still firm, before individual florets can be distinguished.

# Celery

## Description

Celery, Apium graveolens, is an aromatic biennial plant in the family Apicaceae grown primarily for its stalk and taproot  which are used as vegetables.  The rhombic leaves of the celery plant grow in a rosette and are 3–6 cm (1.2–2.4 in) long and 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 in) broad on a branched central stem which is highly ribbed. The plant produces creamy white flowers in dense umbels (an umbrella of short flower stalks) and produces broad oval seeds 1.5–2 mm (<0.1 in) long and wide. Celery is a biennial plant that is commonly grown as an annual and it can reach a height of about 1 m.  Celery may also be referred to as celeriac which is the name given to the root and is believed to have originated in the Eastern Mediterranean.

## Uses

Celery is eaten around the world as a vegetable.  Both the taproot and leaves are often used.  Temperate countries grow celery for its seeds, which are often mixed with salt to make celery salt for seasoning.Basic requirements

Celery is a cool season vegetable which grows best in cool climates in well-draining, fertile soils with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8.. Celery plants grow optimally in cool, moist locations and will tolerate some shade but will not tolerate heat. The plants require constant moisture and can tolerate temperatures between 5 and 27°C (41–80.6°F) with the optimum for growth being between 15–21°C (59–69.8°F). If temperatures drop below 12.7°C (55°F) then the plants will benefit from protective coverings to prevent the plants from bolting (going to seed).

### Sowing seeds

For best results celery should usually be started indoors or in a glasshouse and transplanted to the garden or field. Germination of celery seeds is slow and the seeds should be planted 10 to 12 weeks before the last Spring frost. Soaking seeds in warm water overnight prior to planting can increase germination success. Plant seeds in seedling flats containing a good quality sterile seed starting mix by lately sprinkling a pinch of seeds across the soil surface and covering with a thin layer of starting mix or vermiculite. Place trays in a warm location inside the house or in the glasshouse and keep well-watered. Do not allow the trays to dry out. It is important to keep the soil at the temperature between 12.7 and 21°C (55 and 70°F). The optimum temperature for germination is 60° to 70° (15° to 21° C) and the seedlings should emerge within 2–3 weeks. The seedlings can be potted into individual pots when the are about 5 cm (2 in) tall.

### Transplanting

Seedlings are ready to transplant when they are 15 cm (6 in) tall and have been hardened off.  Prepare the transplant site in advance of planting by working fertilizer or compost into the soil and plant the seedlings when the weather has settled after the last frost. Seedling should be planted at the same depth as their previous container and should be spaced 15–20 cm (6–8 in) apart in rows spaced  60–90 cm (2–3 ft) apart.

General care and maintenance

Celery is a very heavy feeder and should be fed every 10–14 days with a balanced fertilizer. The plants require constant moisture and should be provided with at least 1 inch of water per week. A layer of mulch spread around the plants helps to conserve the moisture in the soil and prevents weeds. Any weeds should be gently removed from around the plants. If temperatures are forecast to drop below 12.7°C (55°F) then the plants should be protected with cloches to prevent them developing weak stalks. Prolonged exposure to temperatures below this threshold will result in bolting.

### Blanching

Blanching is the act of deliberately covering plant parts to prevent photosynthesis, thus keeping the parts pale in color. Many people choose to blanch celery stalks to prevent them becoming bitter. Self-blanching varieties are also available. To blanch celery, the soil can simply be mounded around the stalks to just below the leaves. This can be done gradually as the plants grow, or about two weeks prior to harvest. Alternatively, newspaper or cardboard can be tied around the stalks or boards can be erected around the plants to block out sunlight.

### Harvesting

Celery can begin to be harvested when the stalks are about 20 cm (8 in) tall. Unblanched celery can be harvested as needed by cutting stalks from the outside in. Blanched celery can be harvested by cutting the plant just below the soil line. The plants can be kept in the garden until Fall and will tolerate a light frost but not continuous heavy frosts. If uncovered, the stalks will grow darker in color and the resultant texture will be more fibrous than the young stalks.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial blight and brown stem Pseudomonas cichorii

- Symptoms: Small water-soaked spots on leaf blades which become necrotic and either circular or angular in shape and may develop a chlorotic halo; lesions become dry and rust colored; brown stem symptoms include the development of a brown discoloration of petioles and brown streaks along petioles

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Close plant spacing favors bacterial spread between plants; bacterium causes severe disease symptoms at temperatures above 30°C (86°F)

- Management: Management Control of disease is difficult and usually involve the application of copper sprays in commercial plantations; some control can be achieved by planting less susceptible celery varieties; mechanical transmission can be reduced by only trimming leaves when foliage is dry

#### Soft rot Erwinia carotovora Erwinia chrysanthemi Pseudomonas marginalis

- Symptoms: Small water-soaked lesions near base of petioles which become soft, sunken and brown

- Cause: Bacteria

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fields become infected through infested seed; disease emergence is favored by warm temperatures and prolonged leaf wetness; disease can be differentiated from late blight by the absence of black fungal fruiting bodies embedded in leaves and the typically larger lesions

- Management: Management In areas where warm temperatures and high humidity favor the emergence of early blight, control must rely on a number of different methods: plant pathogen-free seed; rotate crops; avoid overcrowding plants; plant tolerant or resistant celery varieties when conditions are favorable to early blight emergence; apply appropriate fungicides where available

#### Fusarium yellows Fusarium oxysporum

- Symptoms: Yellowing plants that are severely stunted; roots brown and water-soaked; discoloration of vascular tissue in the stems

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus can persist indefinitely in soil once introduced and is usually introduced via infected transplants or contaminated equipment; disease emergence is favored by a soil pH which is close to 7

# Chard

## Description

Chard, Beta vulgaris var cicla, is an herbaceous biennial plant in the family Chenopodiaceae grown for its edible leaves and leaf stalks. The chard plant has an erect growth habit with a basal rosette of leaves with long fleshy petioles which can be red or white in color. The leaves are large and wrinkled with a pronounced midrib and prominent veins. The chard plant can reach 30–40 cm (12–16 in) in height and is usually grown as an annual, harvested after one growing season. Chard may also be referred to as Swiss chard or silverbeet and likely originates from the Mediterranean.

## Uses

All parts of the chard plant are edible. The leaves and petioles (leaf stalks) are usually consumed after cooking with the former being eaten in a similar way to spinach and the latter similar to asparagus.Basic requirements

Chard is best grown in moist, fertile, and organically rich soils. The soil should be light to sandy, and well drained with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. The plants should be positioned in full sun or light shade.  Chard grows best in cool climates and can tolerate moderate frosts although prolonged freezing will cause some varieties to bolt. The optimum temperature for growth is between 15.5 and 18.3°C (60–65°F).

### Planting

Seed may be sown in the ground 30 days prior to the last spring frost as the seedlings are tolerant to moderate frost. Plant one seed every 2.5 cm (1 in) at a depth of 13 mm (0.5 in) in rows spaced 30–40 cm (12–16 in) apart. Keep the seedbed well watered. Seedling should emerge in 5 to 17 days at temperatures between 10 and 24°C (50–75°F). When seedlings have reached between 7 and 10 cm (3–4 in) in height, thin to a final spacing of 7–10 cm (3–4 in) between plants. If planning to harvest entire plants at one time, plant seeds every 2–3 weeks to ensure a continuous supply.

General care and maintenance

Chard  requires plenty of moisture to develop optimally. Even watering will promote the development of good quality roots. Soil moisture can be conserved by applying a layer of mulch around the plants. In addition to moisture, chard benefits from an adequate supply of nutrients. Apply a complete fertilizer at planting to ensure optimum development. Remove any weeds around plants by cultivating shallowly to avoid damaging the developing roots.

### Harvesting

Leaves can be cut from the plant at any point after they develop but if plant is to reach maturity then it is best to remove the outer leaves that have fully developed first.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial soft rot Erwinia spp.

# Cherry (including sour)

## Description

The wild cherry tree, Prunus avium, is a perennial tree in the family Rosaceae grown for its fruit, the cherry.  Cherry trees have alternating simple oval leaves which often have serrated margins and approximately eight pairs of veins, 5–13 cm (2–5 in) long. The flowers are white and appear in clusters of about 3–5. They appear in early spring and are about one inch long. The fruit is dark red, about half an inch to a full inch, matures in early to mid summer. The bark is gray-brown, smooth and glossy and it often peels. Cherry trees can live up to 60 years, growing to a height of over 15 m (50 ft).  Cherry may also be referred to as sweet cherry, gean, mazzard or wild cherry and originates from the Caspian-Black Sea region and Asia.

Sour cherry, Prunus cerasus, is closely related to Prunus avium but with fruit that is more acidic. The tree has twiggy branches with bright red to near black cherries. The tree reaches a height of 4–10 m (13.1–16.4 ft) and is believed to have originated as a natural hybrid of wild cherry (Prunus avium) and ground cherry (Prunus fruticosa) somewhere in the Caucasus Mountains, Turkey or Eastern Europe where the two species' geographic ranges overlap.

## Uses

Cherries are mainly consumed as a fresh fruit or processed into jellies and juices.  The wood of the cherry tree is a distinctive honey color and is used in furniture making and for musical instruments.  Sour cherries are used mainly for canning and processing.Basic requirements

Cherries grow optimally in mild, dry climates and also have a chilling requirement to break dormancy so require cold winters. Because of the cold weather requirement, none of the Prunus family, including cherries, can grow in tropical climates. Cherry trees will grow in a variety of soils provided that they are well-draining. Soils which remain wet for prolonged periods of time and soils that become excessively dry should be avoided.  Trees will perform best if planted in sandy soil with a pH of 5.5–7.5. Planting on a gentle slope is beneficial for cherry as cold air can drain away from the trees to lower areas, helping to prevent damage. Sweet cherries bloom earlier than sour cherries and can be susceptible to damage from late frosts.

## Propagation

Cherry nurseries are mainly propagated by budding and grafting onto 1–2 year old seedling grown from seed. In order to grow from seed, pits should be planted in the fall (after first being chilled) and seedlings will emerge in the spring. A cherry tree will take three-four years to produce its first crop of fruit and seven years to attain full maturity.

### Planting

Cherry trees should be planted in the Spring when all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed. If bare root plants have been purchased, be sure to keep the root ball moist prior to planting. The tree should be planted in a hole which is large enough to accommodate the root ball without bending any of the roots. Broken or damaged roots can be removed but try to avoid pruning the roots. Place the tree in the planting hole and carefully backfill with soil. The tree should be planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery. Carefully firm or tamp the soil to prevent air pockets and when the planting hole is about 2/3 filled, water the roots thoroughly before filling the remainder of the hole with top soil. The tree should be watered as needed throughout the first year of growth.

Training and pruning

Cherry trees are usually trained to a modified central leader system where the lateral limbs branch from a central trunk. Sweet cherries have a more upright growth habit than sour cherries which tend to have a more open and spreading canopy. Trees should only pruned lightly while the tree matures and reaches maximum productivity. Any dead or damaged branches should be removed.

General care and maintenance

The area around the base of the tree should be kept free from weeds either by cultivating or using a chemical weed control. In the home garden, trees are usually surrounded by turf with only a small area of soil around the trunk which is easy to keep weed free by hand. Unless grown in fertile soils, cherry trees may require the addition of some nitrogen fertilizer, the volume of which will vary with the age of the tree. The fertilizer should be applied in a band around the trunk of the tree.

- Symptoms: Cankers on twigs at bases of flower and leaf buds, in pruning wounds or at the base of spurs which exude amber colored gum; cankers spread upwards and form sunken areas in winter; if pathogen enters dormant buds they may be killed or open normally in Spring before collapsing in early Summer; infected buds may be symptomless

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease emergence favors high moisture and low temperatures in the spring; young trees particularly susceptible; trees grown in sandy soils that drain poorly are also susceptible

- Management: Management Ensure that a suitable cherry variety and rootstock is chosen based on geographic location and environmental conditions to prevent stress to tree which predisposes tree to canker disease; apply protective copper spray to trees before flowering; prune trees in early summer to decrease likelihood of infection

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Black knot Apiosporina morbosa

- Symptoms: Elongated swellings (knots) on woody parts of tree which can reach up to 30 cm (12 in) long; knots are initially olive green in color with a corky texture but turn black in color and become hard and brittle; knots grow in length each year

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Infections occur on new shoots after rainfall and knots develop rapidly in second year

- Management: Management Prune knots on twigs and branches 8-10 cm (3-4 in) below the swelling and remove the pruned branches from the orchard; remove knots on older branches by removing the knot plus 2 cm (0.8 in) of surrounding tissue; removal of knots is most effective when done in midsummer; disease can be controlled by application of appropriate fungicides, if available, during shoot elongation

#### Brown rot Monilinia fructicola

- Symptoms: Brown discoloration of fruit skin and inner tissue; fruit skin wrinkled; collapsed flowers exuding sap from their bases; tan cankers with dark edges on twigs; gray-brown spore masses may be present on cankers

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus survives in mummified fruit on the tree, blighted blossoms, cankers and infected twigs; blossom and twig blights are promoted by periods of wet weather

- Management: Management The currently most effective method of controlling brown rot is through the application of appropriate protective fungicides timed so that they are applied when the susceptible flower parts are exposed or after a wet period; avoiding sprinkler irrigation protects the leaves and flowers from wetness that promotes the disease. Cultural control methods include: removing mummified fruit from tree, pruning infected twigs and reducing plant stress by providing adequate levels of water and fertilizer

#### Cherry leaf spot Coccomyces hiemalis

- Symptoms: Small, red-purple spots on upper surfaces of leaves which turn brown and may coalesce; leaves may become chlorotic if there are a few lesions present; if tree becomes severely defoliated fruit may fail to develop properly and remain light in color and watery in texture

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters on infected leaves on the ground; disease development is promoted by warm temperatures and high humidity

- Management: Management Disease can be controlled through applications of appropriate fungicides, Bordeaux mixture is also effective; no cherry varieties are resistant to leaf spot, plant less susceptible varieties if available

#### Powdery mildew Podosphaera spp.

- Symptoms: Light colored circular lesions on leaves inside tree canopy which develop a powdery appearance; lesions may coalesce to cover leaf; if infection is severe, leaves may blister and infected shoots may be distorted and stunted; infected fruits may have slightly depressed areas on the surface containing fungal hyphae (filamentous fungal structures)

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Infection of fruit is more likely if there are rainfalls close to harvest

- Management: Management Management of powdery mildew in cherry is reliant on the application of appropriate fungicides and cultural practices which promote good air circulation around tree canopies to lower humidity

#### Rust Tranzschelia discolor

- Symptoms: Pale yellow-green spots on both upper and lower leaf surfaces which are angular in shape and turn bright yellow in color; spots on lower leaf surface develop orange-red spores

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters in twigs or in leaves which remain attached to the tree

- Management: Management Rust can be prevented by spraying trees with protective fungicides; application is usually carried out one, two and three months before harvest in areas prone to early season outbreaks of the disease and after harvest in areas where disease is less problematic or emerges later in the season

#### Silver leaf Chondrosterum pupureum

- Symptoms: Leaves have a silvery appearance; if infection is severe the leaves may curl upwards and become necrotic; death of individual limbs or entire tree may occur; fungal fruiting bodies appear on the surface of the dead bark

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Pathogen is spread via spores released after rainfall during periods of high humidity and can enter trees through pruning wounds; risk of infection is increased if tree is pruned during late winter or early spring; trees also susceptible when they are heavily pruned

- Management: Management Control of silver leaf disease is difficult and infection can be widespread after rainfall in areas where the disease is present; strategies to reduce the incidence of the disease include: removing all plant debris e.g. pruning waste, stumps, and logs; pruning tree during dry periods and treating large pruning wounds with fungicidal dressing

#### Verticillium wilt Verticillium dahliae

- Symptoms: Withering of leaves on one or more spurs on 1 year old wood; leaves are dull and stunted; fruit small; older cherry trees do not recover from disease

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease is more severe in wet soils

- Management: Management Plant cherry in soil with no history of disease; keep trees adequately fertilized and watered

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Cherry rasp leaf Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV)

- Symptoms: Leaf like growths (enations) on underside of leaves near center; symptoms spread from lower parts of tree upwards; defoliation of limbs; decline of tree

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Distinguished from PNRSV by the leaves remaining green; virus is transmitted by nematodes and through grafting

- Management: Management Fumigants to control nematodes may control cherry rasp leaf

#### Sour cherry yellows Prune dwarf virus (PDV)

- Symptoms: Chlorotic rings or mottled pattern on newly expanded leaves of sour cherry which become necrotic and may drop out of leaves, giving them a shot hole appearance; leaves that expand after the initial symptoms have become visible display lesser and lesser symptoms; one or more years later leaves on infected trees become yellow with green mottle and drop from tree; fruit yield may be reduced by up to 50%; sweet cherry trees develop chlorotic spots or rings with some shot holes; fruiting spurs decrease in later years as the disease progresses; fruit on infected trees are generally firmer and larger than on uninfected

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Virus can infect a wide range of Prunus species

- Management: Management No control strategies are currently known; always purchase certified, disease-free material

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Crown and root rot Phytophthora spp.

- Symptoms: Poor new growth; leaves chlorotic, small in size and sparse; fruit may be small, brightly colored and susceptible to sunburn; shoots may suffer from dieback and tree will often die within weeks or months of first signs of infection or decline gradually over several seasons; root crown may show signs of decay which develops into a canker; bark of infected crown tissue turns dark brown; cankers may occur on aerial parts of plant

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Symptoms can be similar to those of bacterial infections or mechanical damage; severity of disease is linked to soil moisture content; water-saturated soils promote development of disease

- Management: Management Management of phytophthora is reliant on good management of water: cherry trees should be planted in well-draining soil to minimize the frequency and duration of water saturated soil; trees should be propagated from resistant rootstock and application of appropriate systemic fungicides may provide some protection from the disease

### Disease Category: Bacterial, Fungal

#### Crown gall Agrobacterium spp

- Symptoms: Galls on root and/or crown of tree which can range in size from so small they are not visible to the naked eye up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter; galls first become visible as white, fleshy swellings that grow rapidly and become tan to brown in color; galls typically develop at the site of a wound and new galls form adjacent to old ones the next year

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Infection with crown gall begins at the site of plant wounds; disease emergence is favored by poorly-drained, alkaline soils and previous feeding damage by nematodes

- Management: Management Chemical control of the disease is generally ineffective; an effective bacterial biological control is available for commercial production; cultural control methods include: planting only certified, disease-free material, planting cherry in well-draining soil, rotating infected fields with a non-host before peach is planted and also using good sanitation practices

### Disease Category: Other

#### X-disease X-disease mycoplasma-like organism (MLO)

- Symptoms: Rapid or slow decline of tree depending on rootstock; in hypersensitive rootstocks such as Prunus mahaleb cherry scion is rapidly girdled; cherry grafted on susceptible rootstocks exhibit a slow decline over a number of years; leaves on infected limbs are small with a red tinge; fruit may mature late and color development may be incomplete; limbs experience dieback and the tree is killed

- Cause: Mycoplasma-like organism

- Comments: Disease is transmitted by cherry leafhoppers

- Management: Management Most practical control method for X-disease is to remove infected trees and other plant sources which act as a disease reservoir e.g. chokeberry


# Chestnut

## Description

Chestnut (Castanea spp.) is a deciduous tree in the family Fagaceae grown for its edible seeds (nuts). The chestnut tree has a thick trunk covered in gray bark. The trunk has an erect growth habit and can grow 2 m (6.6 ft) in diameter. When the tree stands alone, the canopy can spread 15 m (49 ft) across and is made up of glossy leaves with serrated margins and pointed tips. The leaves are hairy with visible glands on the underside. The chestnut tree produces flowers on long catkins and the seeds are produced in clusters of 1–3. The seeds are covered by a thick, spiny bur which is approximately 10 cm (4 in) in diameter. The kernel within is protected by a thin, dark brown shell. Chestnut trees can reach 40–60 m (131–198 ft) in height and can live for in excess of 150 years. Chestnut may also be referred to by variety and includes European, American, Japanese and Spanish chestnut. The tree originates from Asia.

## Uses

Chestnuts are commonly consumed after roasting or may be processed to produce chestnut creams and purees or for canning.Basic requirements

Chestnuts are hardy trees which will grow in a variety of conditions. The trees grow best in well-draining, acid loam soils and require a pH between 4.5 and 6.5. The trees perform well when planted on a gentle slope which allows cold air to drain to a lower area as well as aiding in soil drainage. Chestnuts should be planted in full sunlight and open fields are preferred for maximum nut production.Chestnut has poor self compatibility and at least 2 trees are required for nut production.

## Propagation

Chestnut trees can be grown from seeds or can be propagated by grafting onto a seedling rootstock. Seedling grown for use as a rootstock for grafting are usually ready to receive a scion when they are two years old. The seedling must have reached a suitable thickness in order to receive a graft (usually when it reaches a thickness similar to that of a pencil).

### Germinating seeds

Chestnut seeds germinate readily but not all will produce a seedling suitable for planting and/or grafting. Seeds can be obtained from breeders or collected from chestnut trees in the Fall. Seeds should be kept refrigerated until planting and can then be directed seeded outdoors or grown in containers inside. Seeds should be planted in early Spring as soon as the soil can be worked. The seed should be planted in a hole 7.5 to 15.0 cm (3-6 in) deep with the radicle (embryo emerging from the seed) facing downwards. If planting in a container, be sure to choose one that is at least 30 cm (12 in) deep and 10 cm (4 in) in diameter. The seeds can be planted earlier if the containers are to be kept indoors.

### Planting seedlings

Seedlings started in containers can be transplanted after all danger of frost has passed and after hardening. The seedling should be planted in a hole that is at least 1.5 times the size of the existing root ball. Gently remove the remnants of the nut from the roots and place the seedling in the hole. Backfill the hole with soil and tamp to remove air pockets. Seedlings should be planted 10–12 m (33–39 ft) apart, allowing an additional 10–12 m (33–39 ft) between rows.  After planting, the seedlings should be watered thoroughly. Continue watering the seed for the first month after planting to help the seedling establish.

General care and maintenance

After planting, the areas around the trees should be kept free from weeds. A layer of mulch spread around the trunks will help suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture. You may have to protect the young trees from pests such as deer which can cause severe damage to the trees. The most effective method of protecting trees is to erect an 8 ft high metal deer fence around the area where the new trees have been planted.

## Common Pests and Diseases

# Chickpea (gram pea)

## Description

The chickpea, Cicer arietinum, is a leguminous annual plant in the family Fabaceae grown for its edible seeds. The plant has a branched, straight or bending stem with small feathery leaves arranged alternately on the stem. The leaves are composed of 11–15 individual leaflets which are oval in shape. The flowers are produced singly or in pairs and can be white, pink, purple or blue in color.  The seed pod is rhomboid or ellipsoid and contains 1–4 cream, brown, green or black seeds.  The chickpea plant can range in height from 20 cm (7.9 in) up to 100 cm (39.4 in) and as an annual, grows over only one growing season.  Chickpea may also be referred to as gram pea, garbanzo bean or ceci bean and originate from south-eastern Turkey.

## Uses

Chickpea is primarily consumed as a dry pulse. The shelled peas are eaten as snack or vegetable. The seed husks can be used as a feed for animals. Chickpeas are also commonly cooked and ground into a paste to produce the popular dish, hummus.General requirements

Chickpeas are cool-season legumes which are best grown as a winter crop in the tropics or as a spring or summer crop in temperate regions. Chickpeas are classified into two distinct types based on seed characteristics. Desi chickpeas have a thick, colored seed coat and the surface of the seed is rough and angular whereas the Kabuli type have white or beige seeds with a smooth surface. Kabuli chickpeas are best grown in temperate areas whereas Desi chickpeas are best suited to semi-arid areas of the tropics. Chickpeas will grow optimally at temperatures between 15 and 29°C (59–84.2°F) with extremes of temperature above 35°C (95°F) and below 15°C (59°F) causing flowers to drop, reducing production. Plants will perform best when planted in well-draining sandy loam soils with a pH between 5.0 and 7.0 in areas where the annual rainfall is between 600 and 1000 mm.

### Planting

Chickpeas are propagated directly from seed with timing of planting depending on the variety being grown and geographic location. Spring crops should be planted when the soil has warmed to at least 5°C (41°F). Chickpeas are leguminous and when planting in a site which has not previously been used for chickpea cultivation, seed should be inoculated with an appropriate type of Rhizobacteria prior to planting. Seed is usually spread by broadcasting or by drilling in rows. Desi types require a seed rate of 30 to 40 kg per hectare whereas Kabuli types require 80 to 100 kg per hectare. The seed should be planted 2 to 12 cm (0.8–4.7 in) deep and when planting in rows, seed should be spaced 10 cm (4 in) apart allowing 25 to 60 cm (9.8 to 23.6 in) between rows. Seedlings usually emerge between 7 and 15 days after sowing depending on temperature.

### General care

In the home garden, chickpea seedlings will benefit from the addition of a layer of mulch after they have emerged to suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture. Plants should be provided with additional irrigation during periods of dry weather but care should be taken not to overwater as this can cause the plants to drop their flowers and/or pods. Application of fertilizer is generally not necessary as chickpeas are leguminous and fix their own nitrogen with the aid of micro-organisms but requirements vary from field to field and management should be based on the results of a soil test. Like other pulses, chickpeas require phosphorus, potassium and micronutrients for growth and application should be based on the results of soil testing. Suppression of weeds in commercial fields is important as chickpeas do not compete well and weed will reduce productivity. Pre- and post-emergence herbicide applications can be helpful for managing weed. If a field has a history of weed problems then it is not suitable for chickpea production.

### Harvesting

Chickpeas are ready to harvest approximately 100 days after planting. in the home garden,  chickpeas can be collected and eaten when green but for dried seeds, the leaves should be allowed to turn brown before collecting the pods. The pods should be allowed to dry and split open before collecting seeds. In commercial production, chickpeas can be harvested by swathing and/or combine.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Ascochyta blight Ascochyta rabiei

- Symptoms: Water-soaked pale spots on young leaves which enlarge rapidly under cool, wet conditions and coalesce to cause blighting of leaves; elongated lesions often cause girdling of the stems which break off; new shoots may form at the breakage points; if pods become infected it can lead to reduced seed set; if infected seeds are planted, the seedlings will develop dark brown lesions at the base of the stem and may dry up and die

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence if favored by wet weather; spores are carried to new plants by wind and water splash

- Management: Management Grow more resistant varieties such as PBA Slasher or Genesis™ 090; even resistant varieties require fungicide application at early podding to ensure high quality seed; more susceptible varieties may require a first fungicide application approximately 4-6 weeks after sowing

#### Fusarium wilt Fusarium oxysporum

- Symptoms: Weak and wilting leaf stems, leaves and flowers; lower leaves drying out and dying; leaves turning brown or pale yellow; splitting the stem reveals discoloration of the inner tissue; leaves turn dull yellow in color and collapse

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors warm, moist soils; disease can be spread by water splash, movement of infected soil and plants and by infected seed

- Management: Management The primary method of controlling the disease is to use resistant varieties; damage can be reduced by application of appropriate fungicides; crop debris should be removed or plowed deeply into the soil after harvest; if disease is present in the soil then a rotation to a non-host for a period of three years can reduce the levels of inoculum in the soil

#### Sclerotinia stem rot (White mold) Sclerotinia sclerotiorum

- Symptoms: Plants rapidly wilting and dying, often without turning yellow; as plants dry out they may turn straw yellow in color; small black fungal bodies (sclerotia) may be present on the surface of the root just below the soil line together with white fluffy mycelium; water soaked lesions may be present on the stem in Spring; infected tissues dry out and may become covered in white mycelium

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors very wet weather conditions; disease is usually introduced to non-infected areas by infected seed

- Management: Management Plant only certified seed; if disease is known to present rotate crops with non-hosts such as cereals; if problem is severe then a 4 year rotation away from susceptible plants may be required; there are no seed treatments or fungicides available to treat the disease

### Disease Category: Fungal, Oomycete

#### Damping-off Pythium spp.

- Symptoms: Failure of seedling to emerge; light brown, seedlings with light brown to redwater-soaked roots and stems; collapse of plants; plant dry up and die; stunted plant growth; rotting taproot with few lateral roots

#### Phytophthora root rot Phytophthora megasperma

- Symptoms: Leaves of plants turning yellow and drying out; decaying roots; small brown lesions on roots which enlarge and create necrotic patches; lesions may girdle stem

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Favors warm, wet soil

- Management: Management Varieties with resistance to the disease are available in most areas where root rot is a problem


# Chicory

## Description

Common chicory, Cichorium intybus, is a perennial herb in the family Asteraceae grown for use as a salad green. Generally, chicory plants have an erect growth habit with numerous lanceolate (lance shaped) leaves branching off of the erect stems. The basal leaves can reach 25 cm (9.8 in) in length and are spatulate (spoon-shaped) and may be green or red in color. There are two rows of bracts (modified leaves) on the stems, the inner are longer and erect and the outer are shorter and spreading The foliage is commonly covered in hairs.  The plant produces bright blue or sometimes pink or white flowers which are 2–4 cm (0.79–1.6 in) in diameter.  Chicory can grow to a height of  0.6–1.2 m (2.0–3.9 ft) and is usually grown as a biennial.  Chicory may also be referred to by variety and these include Common chicory, Italian dandelion, Witloof, Belgian endive and radicchio. Chicory likely originates from the Mediterranean.

## Uses

Chicory is predominantly grown for its leaves which are used as salad greens or cooked. The witloof variety is also grown for its root which can be ground and used as a coffee substitute.Basic requirements

Many types of chicory are available for the home garden and the chosen variety depends ultimately on its desired use. Radicchio types are grown for their leaves whereas witloof types may be grown for their roots and leaves. Chicory is a cool season crop and radicchio varieties require cool temperatures to produce heads. Plants will grows best in fertile, well draining soils with a pH between 6.5 and 7.2 and should be positioned in full sun.

### Planting

Chicory can be direct seeded or started indoors for transplanting. If started indoors, seeds should be sown in a sterile seed starting mix by planting to a depth of 0.6 cm (0.25 in). Thin the seedlings when they have 3 to 4 sets of true leaves. The seedlings are ready for transplanting when they are about 5 to 6 weeks old and have 5 or six mature leaves. Seedlings should be hardened prior to transplanting by gradually increasing their exposure to outdoor conditions. Space seedlings 20 to 23 cm (8-9 in) apart allowing 20 cm (8 in) between rows. Directly seeded plants should be thinned to this spacing.

General care and maintenance

Plants should be protected from frosts with row covers or fabric to prevent damage. The plants will benefit from a layer of organic mulch such as grass clippings or leaves which will help to suppress weeds while conserving moisture in the soil. Plants should be kept moist during growth to prevent the development of bitter tasting leaves. Chicory generally requires 1 to 2 inches of water a week but this will depend on the type of soil and the prevailing climatic conditions.

### Harvesting

Radicchio varieties should be harvested when the leaves have reached their full size. Harvesting should not be delayed as it results in the leaves developing a bitter flavor. Cut the head from the plant using a sharp knife to cut through the stem just below the head. Witloof varieties grown for leaves should be harvested while the leaves are young and tender. If the plants are being grown for their roots then they should be pulled from the soil just before the last frost date. The leaves should be trimmed to about 2.5 cm from the crown and the roots should be trimmed to a uniform size. Store the trimmed plants at 0°C (32°F) for 5 to 7 weeks before forcing.

### Forcing

Forcing is the term used to describe the process by which witloof chicory varieties are forced to produce new growth in winter. The forcing process is commonly carried out by transplanting the plants into sand filled boxes or buckets which are then stored in a frost free place such as a glasshouse, shed or basement where temperatures are between 10 and 15.55°C (50-60°F).The chicory plants should be planted in the sand, leaving the crown exposed and then either kept in darkness if in a basement or covered if in a glasshouse. It is important that no light is able to reach the plants. The plant will begin to produce a tightly packed head of leaves called a chicon. Chicons are ready for harvest within 3-5 weeks.

## Common Pests and Diseases

# Chilli Pepper

## Description

All chilli peppers are varieties of several plant species in the genus Capsicum, including Capsicum annuum (e.g. jalapeños and cayennes), C. frutescens (e.g. tabasco and piri piri), C. chinense (e.g. habaneros and Scotch bonnet), C. pubescens (e.g. rocoto and locoto) and C. baccatum (e.g. aji peppers) and their hybrids which include some of the hottest peppers known. Unsurprisingly, the plants are most commonly grown for the harvest of their fruits, which are used as a spice. Hot peppers are perennial plants with varying structure. They can be herbaceous or shrub-like but are generally branching with green-brown stems and simple oval leaves. The plants produces flowers with five teeth (petals) which are usually white in color. Chilli pepper plants can reach heights in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 m (1.6–4.9 ft) tall and although they are perennial species, they are commonly grown as annuals, with fruit being harvested for one growing season. Chilli peppers may also be referred to as hot peppers or hot chillis. C. annuum species are believed to have originated from Mexico, while the others are all likely to have originated from South America.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Capsicum spp. (C. annuum, C. frutescens)

Common Name: Sweet pepper, Bell pepper, Chilli, Hot pepper, Pilipili (Swahili)

## Uses & Benefits

Hot peppers can be eaten fresh or cooked as a vegetable, seasoning or garnish. Chili peppers have amazingly high levels of vitamins and minerals.

## Varieties

Cultivars commonly grown in Kenya: Sweet pepper (C. annuum), California Wonder, Yolo wonder, Emerald Giant, Ruby Giant, Hot pepper (C. frutescens), Anaheim, Fresno, Jalapeno, Long Red Cayenne, Rocket, Short Bullet.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Peppers are warm-season crops and grow best at temperatures between 18 and 30°C (65–86°F). They can be grown in many soil types although sandy soils warm faster in Spring and are good for early planting. The soil should have a pH between 6 and 7. Peppers will not tolerate water saturated soil and should be planted in a well draining soil or raised bed. Peppers should be planted in an area that receives full sun for most of the day.

### Growing from Seed

In most cases, pepper seeds should be started indoors 8–10 weeks before the last Spring frost. Pepper should only be direct seeded in areas with a long, warm growing season, otherwise seeds should be sown indoors in flats or cell trays using a sterile seedling mix. Plant seeds to a depth of 1.3 cm (1/2 in) and water lightly. Seeds should not be allowed to dry out as there will be a negative impact on germination rates.Trays should be positioned in a warm, bright, South facing window or under fluorescent lighting. The optimum soil temperature for germination is 21–29°C(70–85°F). A heat mat can be used to warm the flats if required. Seedlings will emerge within 8–25 days and after the seedlings has developed two sets of true leaves then they can be moved to a larger (3-4 in) pot. Seedlings should be provided with ample light and adequate fertilizer.

### Transplanting

Peppers are usually transplanted 2–3 weeks after the last frost when the soil temperature has reached a minimum of 15.5°C (60°F). Covering soil with dark plastic or mulch a week prior to planting outdoors can help bring the soil temperature up more quickly in colder regions, allowing earlier planting. Beginning approximately 7–10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/264). The hardening off process is very important as peppers are very susceptible to transplant shock. The planting site should be prepared by incorporating plenty of organic matter to encourage vegetative growth. When transplanting seedlings, allow 30–45 cm (12–18 in) between plants and 60–76 cm (24–30 in) between rows. Side dress plants with a nitrogen fertilizer at planting. Drip or soaker irrigation is preferred to overhead irrigation and plants should be watered evenly to keep them moist. Mulching around the plants can also help to conserve soil moisture.

General care and maintenance

Peppers will benefit from applications of fertilizer to keep them supplied with essential nutrients. A timed release fertilizer can be applied at bloom or the plants can be fed with a liquid fertilizer at planting and every two weeks thereafter. In addition, pepper plants can produce a heavy load of fruit and it can be helpful to provide the plants with some support using stakes or cages to prevent branches from breaking under the weight. Use a soft material to tie plants to stakes or cages.

# Chinese cabbage

## Description

Chinese cabbage can refer to two subspecies of cabbage belonging to the family Brassicaceae, Brassica rapa pekinensis (napa cabbage) and Brassica rapa chinensis (bok-choy).  Napa cabbage has a barrel shaped, elongated rosette of overlapping leaves which point inwardly and can grow 25–51 cm (10–20 in) tall, with a diameter of 15–20 cm (6–8 in).  Napa cabbage may also be called Chinese leaf  or wong-bok and originates from the Beijing region of China. The bok choy type cabbage is made up of about 30 individual leaves arranged into a loose, spiral head and are dark green and shiny. The petioles, or stalks, are white or light green and thick and fleshy.  Bok choy can reach a height of 15–60 cm (0.5 to 2 ft) and spread outwards by 15–46 cm (0.5–1.5 ft). Bok choy may also be referred to as pak choi, Chinese chard, Chinese mustard, celery mustard or spoon cabbage and also originates from China

## Uses

Napa cabbage and bok choy are usued in similar ways. The inner leaves of napa cabbage are eaten raw or cooked in stir fries and other dishes while the tougher outer leaves are often used in soups. Both the leaves and stems of bok choy are edible and can be eaten raw or can be cooked in stir fries and other dishes.Napa cabbage is a cool season annual plant and as such will grow best in temperatures averaging between 13 and 21°C (55–70°F), with optimum growth occurring between 15–18°C (59–64°F). Seed should be planted in the fall, 1.5 cm (0.6 in) deep in a well draining soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. Transplants can be taken from a 4–5 week old plant if a spring crop is desired. The plants can be grown on flat or raised beds and positioned in rows 50–60 cm (20–24 in) apart.  Each plant should be spaced 50 cm (20 in) from its neighbor for optimum growth.

Bok choy is most successfully grown in regions that experience cool summers and mild winters, growing optimally in temperatures between 15 and 20°C (59–68°F).  Bok choy can be planted in early spring if the required climatic conditions are met, producing a crop in early summer or they can be planted in early summer for a late summer crop. The seeds will germinate quickly and seedlings are fast growing. Transplants may also be used.  Seed should be sown at a depth of 15 to 20 mm (0.6–0.7 in) in soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0 and plant should be spaced approximately 20 cm (8 in) from one another.

# Chives

## Description

Chives, Allium schoenoprasum, are perennial herbs in the family Liliaceae grown for their leaves which are used as culinary herbs. The chive plant is a member of the onion family and forms small bulbs from the roots. The leaves of the plant are tapering, hollow and cylindrical and have a soft texture. The chive plant grows in clumps and produces large pale purple flowers in a dense clusters of 10–30 individual inflorescences. Chives grow to approximately 46 cm (18 in) in height and can live for many years in favorable conditions. The exact origin of the chive plant is disputed but it grows wild in Europe, Australia and North America.

## Uses

Chives are consumed fresh as a culinary herb in a variety of dishes.Basic requirements

Chives are easy to grow and tolerate a range of soil types and conditions. Chives will grow best in a well-draining soil, rich in organic matter with a pH of 6-7 and will perform optimally when positioned in full sunlight but will tolerate partial shade.

## Propagation

Starting from seeds

Chives can be grown directly from seed or new plants can be produced by dividing an established plant. Seeds can be started indoors approximately 4 weeks prior to the last frost date and should be planted in flat trays containing sterile seed starting mix. Plant seeds to a depth of 1.3 cm (0.5 in). The seeds are slow to germinate, emerging after about 7 days but the seedlings develop quickly and are ready to be transplanted when they are about 4 weeks old and after they have been hardened.

### Dividing plants

Established plants should be divided in the Spring. Start by watering the plants a few hours before dividing to soften the soil and ensure the plants are turgid. Identify individual groups of plants and plant to take 3 to 4 of these together to form a new clump. Cut the chives back to a height of approximately 10 cm (4 in) and carefully extract the existing plant from the soil. Break the clump by dropping the plant from a gentle height to break it apart into separate plants.

### Transplanting

Individual plants or seedlings should be planted 20 to 30 cm (8-12 in) apart. Plant divided plants about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) deeper than they were previously. Keep the plants moist to aid in the establishment of the root system.

### Harvesting

Chives can be harvested at any time once plants are established. To harvest leaves simply snip them with a pair of scissors leaving about 3 cm (2 in) of green on the plant. Begin harvesting from the outside leaves inwards as required. The plants will quickly produce new growth.

General care and maintenance

Chives benefit from the application of a layer of mulch in the Spring, grass clipping or leaves are ideal and help to conserve soil moisture and suppress weeds. When plants flower, remove the flower head when it starts to dry out and die in order to divert energy to the production of leaves. Chives require the application of fertilizer at regular intervals throughout the growing season unless they were planted in composted manure. A liquid fertilizer should be applied every 4 to 6 weeks.

# Cinnamon

## Description

Cinnamon is the collective name given to several plant species in the genus Cinnamomum (family Lauraceae), including Cinnamomum verum (syn. Cinnamomum verum; Ceylon cinnamon) and Cinnamomum burmanni (Indonesian cinnamon), grown for their inner bark which is used as a flavoring. Cinnamon trees are small evergreens with aromatic bark and leaves. The leaves of the tree are thick and oval or lanceolate in shape, growing on smooth gray branches. The tree produces small yellow or green flowers on panicles and a berry fruit. Cinnamon trees can reach heights of up to 20 m (66 ft) in the wild but are usually coppiced to smaller bushes under cultivation. Cinnamon trees have an economic lifespan of approximately 10 years. Cinnamon may be referred to as cassia and originates from Asia.

## Uses

Pieces of dried cinnamon bark (quills) or ground cinnamon are used a flavoring in baked goods, confection or savory dishes. Oil extracted from the bark and leaves is used as a flavoring or scent in perfumes.Basic requirements

Cinnamon is a tropical plant and grows best in warm areas with high humidity where average temperatures reach approximately 27°C (80.6°F). Cinnamon can be grown in a wide range of soils but the highest quality bark is obtained when trees are grown in sandy soils rich in humus. Cinnamon grows best when planted in full sun but as a forest tree it will tolerate some shading. Trees require an average annual rainfall of between 1250 and 2500 mm.

## Propagation

Cinnamon can be grown from seed or vegetatively propagated. Fruits often have to be bagged in order to save the seeds as they are often consumed by birds. Planting material should be selected from trees showing the desired bark characteristics which are healthy and vigorous regardless of the propagation method used. Cinnamon trees are usually cultivated commercially through cutting or by air layering due to the seeds exhibiting a wide genetic variability.

### Propagation from seed

Seeds should be collected from the pulp of the fruit, washed and dried. Seeds should be planted as soon as possible after extraction as they do not remain viable for long. Seeds should be planted in prepared nursery beds or in polyethylene bags filled with good quality potting soil or aged compost or composted manure. The seedbed or bags should be provided with shading to protect the seedlings and seeds should be kept moist with frequent irrigation. Germination usually occurs after approximately 20 days. Seedlings can be transplanted to the field after about 3 months.

### Vegetative propagation

Cinnamon can be propagated vegetatively from cuttings, by layering or by dividing the root ball. A cutting is usually taken by removing a partially mature shoot with at least one node from an established mother plant. The shoot should then be planted in a polyethylene bag to establish its own root system, thus creating a new tree. Cuttings are usually grown under the protection of a polyethylene covering which is removed gradually to harden the seedlings for field planting. Seedling are ready to be transplanted to the field when they are 12 to 18 months old.

### Transplanting

Seedlings should be planted in a pre-dug hole large enough to accommodate the root ball and backfilled with topsoil. Adding rock phosphate to the planting hole aids in root development. Trees are often grown in small groups to produce a single clump or are planted individually. For commercial production, field spacings of between 0.9 m (3 ft) to 1.2 m (4 ft) per tree are recommended.

# Clove

## Description

Clove, Syzygium aromaticum, is a monoecious (both male and female flowers on the same plant) evergreen tree in the family Myrtaceae grown for its aromatic flowers. The many branches of the tree are semi-erect with smooth oval shaped leaves. The branches end with a 3–4 flowers near the tip with one terminal flower and the others opening below it. The leaves, flowers and bark all have a distinct smell. The clove is the unopened flower buds. The tree grows 8–15 m (26–50 ft) tall and can live to be more than 100 years old. The clove tree may also be referred to as tropical myrtle and are native to the Molucca Islands.

## Uses

The vast majority of commercially cultivated cloves are used by the tobacco industry to flavor cigarettes.  Cloves are also used commonly as spices, either in their whole form or after first grinding into powder.Basic requirements

Clove trees require a warm, tropical climate with an average rainfall of at least 1500 mm per year. Clove trees are very susceptible to stress. Areas that undergo a dry season are good for flowering but the tree must be planted in an area with deep, fertile soil to limit water stress. Clove trees grow optimally at  temperatures between 16 and 27°C (65–80°F) in rich loamy, well draining soil.

## Propagation

Clove is commercially propagated from seeds which are planted soon after harvest. Seeds should be collected and extracted from the fruits of healthy mother plants exhibiting desirable characteristics. The seeds are extracted by soaking the fruits in water and peeling the skin from the fruit. The seeds can be planted in prepared nursery beds or polyethylene bags containing a mixture of soil and aged manure and should be planted to a depth of 2 to 5 cm (0.8-2.0 in) and spaced 12 to 15 cm (4.7-5.9 in) apart. Germination usually occurs within 1 to 6 weeks. The seedlings should be shaded to protect them from harsh sunlight. The seedlings should be kept moist through regular watering and can be transplanted when they reach at least 30 cm (11.8 in) in height. The seedlings should be hardened off by exposing them to increasing amounts of sunlight before the are transplanted to the field.

### Transplanting

General care and maintenance

Once the temporary shade plants are removed, the plantation should be kept free from weeds by weeding once or twice each year or by applying a layer of mulch around the trees. Mulch helps prevent the roots being damaged by the physical removal of the weeds. Trees may require additional irrigation during dry periods to prevent them becoming stressed which harms their production. The trees should also be provided with nutrients in the form of fertilizer or manure. The composition and amount of fertilizer required is dependent on the region and soil type.

### Harvesting

The complete inflorescence (flower) should be picked just before the first buds open to ensure maximum size and oil content of the buds. The harvest is often conducted over 3 to 8 pickings during the season as buds mature. After harvesting, the buds are laid out to dry in the sun for several days.

## Common Pests and Diseases

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Bacteria are limited to the water-carrying vessels in the tree (xylem); the disease is thought to be transmitted by Hindola striata and Hindola fulva , both sucking insect species

- Management: Management An antibiotic - oxytetracycline - can be injected into the tree to slow the decline of infected trees but there is currently no known cure for the disease; several insecticides can give control of Hindola insect species which are believed to spread the disease


# Clover

## Description

Clover is the common name given to a group of approximately 300 leguminous plants in the genus Trifolium, in the family Fabaceae. Several species are cultivated specifically for fodder.  The most commonly cultivated is white clover, Trifolium repens. Clover species are generally small and are usually trifoliate (leaves possess three leaflets) although some species possess five or seven leaflets. The clover plant has smooth stems and produces small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers made up up many florets. Clover species can be can be annual, biennial or short-lived perennials.  White clover may live for 3–5 years, and can reach a height of 20–30 cm (8–12 inches).  Clover may also be referred to as Ladino clover, Dutch clover or trefoil and it originates from Europe.

## Uses

Clover is mainly cultivated to provide pasture or to protect soil.  It may be harvested and used as forage, hay or silage.Basic requirements

White clover is the most widely grown clover in the world, growing best in a cool, moist, temperate climate. It can be grown on a wide range of soils but performs best in well-draining clay or loam as opposed to sandy soils. The plant will grow optimally at a soil pH of 5.5 and 7.0. Dry soils are not recommended due to the shallow root system. Clover tolerates shade, repeated mowing and field traffic very well making it well suited to use as a cover crop.

### Planting

Clover is direct seeded either by drilling or broadcasting. When growing clover as a commercial crop, a higher yield will be obtained in warmer areas if the seed is inoculated with Rhizobacteria before planting. Inoculation is not necessary if an inoculated clover crop was grown in the same field within the past 3 years or in colder regions where nitrogen-fixing bacteria can persist in the soil. If broadcasting seed, spread 5–14 lb (2.25–6.35 kg) of seed per acre and cover. When drilling seed, 3–9 lb (1.4–4 kg) of pure seed should be planted per acre to a depth of 6–12 mm (1/4 – 1/2 in). Clover is also commonly sown into an existing grass pasture or with grass seed to establish a mixed pasture. Seeding rates into an existing grass pasture should be 2–4 lb (0.9–1.8 kg) per acre. The soil should be kept moist after seeding to promote germination.

General care and maintenance

If grown as a forage crop mixed with grass, management should be aimed at maintaining clover at 40 to 50% of the total cover. Grazing to a stubble height of 5 cm (2 in) favors the growth of the clover, whereas lighter grazing will favor the growth of grass. The pasture should be fertilized with nitrogen and phosphorous depending on the needs of the particular soil. When grown as a living mulch, clover should be mowed as required and killed off when no longer needed. Clover can be killed by rototilling, undercutting or moldboard plowing. White clover can be persistent and it is necessary to kill off the root system to effectively kill the plants.

# Cocoa (cacao)

## Description

Cocoa is an evergreen tree in the Malvaceae family that is grown for its seeds (beans), which are primarily used in the production of chocolate.

A cocoa tree is a branching tree with simple, pointed (lanceolate) leaves that can reach up to 10 cm in width and 61 cm in length. The tree bears clusters of pale-yellow flowers with five petals and sepals each. Cocoa pods (drupes) can be green-white, yellow, purplish, or red in color, with 20-50 seeds arranged in five distinct rows.

Cocoa may also be referred to as cacao, koko or Kacao and originates from upper Amazon region of South America.

The ripe cocoa fruits are yellow, greenish, yellow-red, and red to red-brown.

They have the shape of American football balls. They grow to be about 25 cm long and have a thick shell. In the center is a white, sweet pulp with 25 to 50 seeds arranged in five rows. Each one is about 2-3 cm long. They are encased in white mucus.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Theobroma cacao

Common Name: English (Mother of cocoa, Mexican lilac, quikstick)

## Uses & Benefits

Cocoa seeds have a high fat content and thus provide an energy-rich and delicious food. Cocoa is grown in all humid and tropical countries. Côte d'Ivoire (the world's largest cocoa producer) is the leading cocoa producer in Africa, followed by Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.

Chocolate, cocoa powder, and butterfat are the main products made from cocoa beans which are all consumed by humans. Butterfat is also used in cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, but the amount used is insignificant in comparison to that used in chocolate production. Raw cocoa (dried cocoa seeds) is the most sought-after product on the international market, and it is used to make cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and chocolate.

## Varieties

We have three main varieties of cocoa:

-Criollo.

-Forastero.

-Trinitario.

### Criollo

Criollo is a noble and extremely rare group of many varieties. It now accounts for less than 1% of global production, despite dominating 200 years ago. It is indigenous to Colombia and Venezuela.

It is also grown commercially in Peru, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Madagascar, and the Caribbean region.

Types of Cocoa Criollo example from Venezuela

### Criollo guasare

It is grown south of Lake Maracaibo. Its plantations are currently quite small. It is distinguished by a green fruit with a thin, slightly rough shell. This is a high-quality cocoa.

### Criollo chuao

Its among the most famous type cocoa grown in the world, it is mainly grown in the Chuao region of Aragua state. It is classed as fine cocoa.

### Criollo porcelain

It is grown in the southern regions of Lake Maracaibo. It has a distinct flavor and is considered extremely fine cocoa by experts. It is thought to have the highest genetic quality of all Venezuelan cocoa trees.

### Forastero

Forastero is native to the Amazon basin, which is why it is also known as Cacao Amazonico. Because of its high yield, this cocoa is also known as Cacao Corriente or ordinary cocoa. It is currently grown in many regions, primarily in Africa (Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire). The Spaniards first brought this cocoa from Venezuela. According to various sources, it accounts for 85-95% of global production. The relatively low requirements and ease of cultivation account for such a large share. It is relatively resistant to diseases and pests. It grows faster and produces more than the other groups.

The appearance of individual Forastero varieties varies. There are numerous subspecies, including Cundeamor, Calabacillo and Amelonado.

### Trinitario

Trinitario cocoa has a delicate flavor. It is a cross between the two varieties mentioned above. It was chosen during the seventeenth century. The trees were brought to Trinidad from Venezuela. It was a big hit. Trinidad produced the best cocoa beans for several decades.

Trinitario's global market share is currently less than 10%. The aroma of Trinitario is forastero, and the flavor is delicate criollo.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Cocoa grows in the so-called under-storey of primary forests and is associated with a number of palm species as well as a number of other tree species. For example, in rain forests, tree varieties from the upper storey, primarily single trees overtopping the forest canopy, lose their foliage during the months of shorter daylight hours. The increased light encourages the development of cocoa blossoms, and the falling leaves provide organic material enrichment.

The plantations can survive on 1250 mm of rainfall per year if the annual distribution is even (100 mm per month). Heavy clouds and high humidity can compensate for short drought periods. The annual average temperature should be around 25° C. Harvesting periods are reduced to a few months per year in regions with extensive wet periods or large seasonal temperature fluctuations. Cocoa produces fruit almost all year in regions with a balanced climate and only minor temperature and rainfall fluctuations. As a result, cocoa is a typical crop of the tropical lowlands. If other conditions are favorable, it can also be grown at higher altitudes.

Cocoa has shown to develop more quickly in areas without a dry season than in the major production areas of West Africa, where growth is slowed by drought during certain months of the year.

Cocoa plantations should have deep, well-drained soil with adequate water retention. Soils with a high available moisture-storage capacity can compensate for lack of rain. The pH of the solution should be between 4.0 and 7.5. It is critical to ensure that there is enough organic material available. Cocoa trees can live for more than a century. Naturally occurring cocoa crops reproduce through lateral shoots that can appear at any height on the trunk. Natural vegetative proliferation occurs when small rodents and apes spread the seeds.

### Growing from Seed

Cocoa is typically planted as seedlings, which are simple and inexpensive to produce. To establish seed gardens, vegetative propagation via rooted cuttings or budding is used. In a shaded nursery, seedlings are typically raised in polythene bags.

At the age of 4 - 6 months, young plants are planted in the field 3 - 4 m apart. Young trees require shade to reduce irradiance, buffer the microenvironment, and promote proper tree shape and habit. The need for shade is reduced when a closed canopy is formed. Cocoa can only be grown without shade under the most favorable soil and nutrient conditions.

In order to extend the economic life of plantations, some shade is usually required to reduce moisture stress and the incidence of insect damage.

Shade can be obtained by either thinning the forest or planting shade trees. Shade trees are common in South-East Asia, where they are mostly seedless and Mother of cocoa.

Hedges of leguminous shrubs are frequently used for temporary side protection between rows as well as a source of mulch. Cocoa can also be grown as an intercrop with coconuts.

### General Care and Maintenance

The natural site requirements of cocoa should be followed when selecting a location for a new plantation. Sites with alluvial soils that are resistant to waterlogging are ideal. Other appropriate locations include irrigated form wells and hollows. Steep and convex slopes are unsuitable locations. When establishing a new plantation, take care to replicate the natural structure of forests as closely as possible. This means that in the agroecosystem, all of the varieties that will be cultivated alongside cocoa should be planted at the same time (or even before) the cocoa.

The best method is to leave an area open for natural growth and plant tall- growing trees that will quickly provide cover, such as bananas and manioc, and then plant cocoa in between them later. The biological activity of the soil is maintained in this manner, and the cocoa mycorrhiza can begin to develop immediately.

### Harvesting

The most vital characteristics of cocoa are dependent on proper processing, which begins with harvesting and ends with storage. Pod development takes about 6 months from seed to maturity. When the pods are completely ripe, harvesting can begin. An orange discoloration of the shell distinguishes many Trinitario types with their red and dark violet pods. When other varieties are ripe, they turn yellow.

Depending on the region and weather conditions, there are usually one or two harvesting phases that last several months. It is best to harvest all of the ripened pods every 2-3 weeks to ensure uniform ripeness of the harvested pods. Each week during peak production, pods are harvested.

To avoid damaging of the bark, use a sharp knife or other suitable instrument to cut off the pods at the base of the blossom.

### Post-harvest Processes

After harvest, the cocoa fruit is fermented, dried, and stored. Farmers remain vulnerable to production losses during these processes and the quality and flavor of the product is defined by the environment and the methods used.

### Fermentation

There are various ways in which farmers can engage in the process of cocoa fermentation. After the cocoa beans and pulp are removed from the husk, smallholders typically cover the heaps of cocoa with plantain or banana leaves and let them ferment for approximately five days. This traditional approach to fermentation, however, is susceptible to environmental risk factors. Periods of intense rainfall increase the time required for fermentation. Temperature changes, droughts, and prolonged dry seasons affect the flavor and overall quality of the product. Unlike farmers in West Africa, cocoa farmers in Latin America tend to ferment the cocoa pulp surrounding the beans using wooden boxes. In Indonesia, farmers rarely take part in the fermentation process because their production is valued mostly for cocoa butter which is unaffected by fermentation.

### Drying

The next step after fermentation is the drying of the cocoa beans. Under inadequate methods and circumstances, drying can result in production losses and loss of quality. Farmers may either sun dry their beans or use an artificial drying technique. The former is common in countries that have a significant dry period during which to carry out drying and it involves placing the cocoa seeds on a surface exposed to the sun either on mats, trays, or concrete. Artificial drying involves the use of an artificial source of heat such as fires. Intensive rainfall can cause molding of cocoa beans and reduce quality. While temperature changes alter the time required for drying, droughts and dry periods will increase the speed at which cocoa dries. CSC recommends the use of solar dryers, which are easy to build using wood and clear plastic. Solar dryers avoid the GHG emissions of artificial drying and protect cocoa from excessive humidity.

### Storage

In temperate climates, cocoa can be safely stored for years. High temperatures and humidity, on the other hand, cause a rapid infestation of storage pests and infection with mould fungi in the moist tropics. Because cocoa is highly hygroscopic, even a well-dried product can increase in moisture content by up to 10% in areas with 80-90% humidity, reducing its storage capacity. For storage, the critical moisture content is 8%.

Cocoa should be stored in air-permeable sacks for a short period of time on the production site, and the sacks should be stacked on wooden planks or boards.

Sacks made of organic material that have been treated with pesticides should be avoided since the cocoa butter component of the cocoa shell is an excellent solvent for chlorinated hydrocarbons, which can diffuse through the outer shell and into the cocoa seed when they come into contact with it. In such cases, tests have revealed that limits for certain agricultural poisons were exceeded despite the fact that no pesticides had ever been used on the site.

The storage area should be well-ventilated at all times, with the inside temperature remaining below the outside temperature.

It is common practice on conventional plantations to gas the cocoa with methyl bromide to protect it from storage pests. However, the use of methyl bromide is no longer permitted.

Tetraline soap, hydrogen phosphide, and prussic acid are also employed. It is not permitted to use insecticides against storage pests or to gas the beans on organic cocoa plantations. Cocoa beans should be stored at low temperatures in dark, dry, well-ventilated rooms. Short-term storage temperature: approximately 16°C; relative humidity: 55% Long-term storage temperature: 11°C; relative humidity: 55

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Black pod (Phytophthora pod rot) Phytophthora palmivora Phytophthora megakarya Phytophthora capsici

- Symptoms: Translucent spots on pod surface which develop into a small, dark hard spots; entire pod becomes black and necrotic with 14 days of initial symptoms; white to yellow downy growth on black areas; internal tissues become dry and shriveled resulting in mummified pods

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Disease occurs in all cocoa growing areas; P. megakarya is most destructive in Central and West Africa whereas P. capsici is most common in Central and South America

- Management: Management Protective sprays of copper containing fungicides in combination with systemic fungicides are often recommended to control the disease; cocoa plants should be well spaced to allow good air circulation through the plantation; mummified pods should be removed and destroyed to reduce spread

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Cocoa swollen shoot Cocoa swollen shoot virus (CSSV)

- Symptoms: Swelling of leaves and shoots; red leaf veins, notably in young leaves; chlorotic patches next to leaf veins; chlorotic spots or flecks on leaves mottled, smooth pods with reduced beans; mottled coloration on pods; stems may develop swellings at nodes or internodes and shoot tips; progressive defoliation may occur ultimately leading to the death of the tree.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Only occurs in West Africa. Major problem in Togo, Ghana, Cote d'Ivorie and Nigeria; transmitted by mealybugs. The Swollen Shoot Virus is not native to cocoa but jumped into the cocoa from trees that grew in the rain forests of W. Africa (e.g. Cola chlamydanta, Ceiba pentandra, Adansonia digitata, Cola gigantean and Sterculia tragacantha). The virus is a badnavirus within the family Caulimoviridae.

- Management: Management Infected trees and those surrounding them should be removed and destroyed (up to 5 m from infected tree if less than 10 trees are infected and up to a distance of 15 m if greater than 100 trees are infected) to prevent further spread; a gap should be placed between cocoa plantations of at least 10 m (33 ft) and it may be possible to isolate cocoa plantations using a non- host crop such as oil palm growing between plantations.

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Frosty pod (Monilia pod rot, Watery pod rot) Moniliophthora roreri

- Symptoms: Spots on surface of immature pods; spots turning brown and rapidly enlarging to cover entire pod surface; disease affects only actively growing pods.

- Comments: Causes serious losses in South-Western parts of South America; spores are dry and powdery and are spread easily by water movement, wind or movement of pods; disease spread is highest during periods of high rainfall.

- Management: Management Planting cocoa varieties that produce pods during the dry season allows the pod to avoid the disease; pods showing symptoms of disease should be removed to prevent spread; application of copper containing fungicides will help reduce disease incidence.

#### Witches' broom Moniliophthora perniciosa

- Symptoms: Characteristic proliferation of shoots and brooms from bud; production of branches which do not produce fruit; distorted pods with green patches which give an appearance of uneven ripening.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: One of the most devastating cocoa diseases in South America; disease is widespread throughout South America, the Caribbean and Panama; spread of disease greatly influenced by humidity with emergence favored by high temperature and high humidity (>80%).

- Management: Management Good sanitation is the most effective method of controlling the disease; material known to be infected should be removed and destroyed; removal of infected material can be difficult as there may be no visible symptoms; new fungicides and resistant cocoa varieties are being developed to help control the disease.


# Coconut

## Description

The coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, is an erect palm in the family Arecaceae which is grown its fruits, used primarily for the extraction of coconut oil for use in cooking. The coconut palm has an erect or slightly curved stem which grows from a swollen base. The stem is smooth, light gray in color and has prominent leaf scars. The stem is topped with a crown of 60–70 spirally arranged leaves. The leaves are long (up to 7 m/23 ft), pinnately divided and composed of 200–250 tapering leaflets. The inflorescence is a spike produced at the leaf axil with 20–60 branches, each with a female flower at the base and many male flowers. The fruit is a drupe containing a single seed. It is ovoid in shape with three sides divided by ridges. The exocarp and the mesocarp make up the husk of the coconut. The seed is protected by a thick, stony shell, or endocarp, and is partially filled with a liquid known as coconut water. The edible endosperm is white and meaty and can be between 1.0 and 2.5 cm (0.4–1.0 in) thick. Coconut palms can reach a height of 30 m (98 ft), produce up to 75 fruits a year, and live for up to 90 years. The origin of the coconut is unknown although the center of genetic diversity lies in Southeast Asia.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Cocos nucifera

Common Name: Mnazi (Swahili)

## Uses & Benefits

Coconuts are primarily cultivated for their oil. The oil is extracted from the endosperm and is used in cooking. Low grade oils are used in the production of soaps. The endosperm can be consumed fresh or dry and is commonly grated for use in baking. Young coconuts, termed waternuts, are commonly sold in tropical resorts, where the liquid is drunk directly from the shell. Coconuts may also be used to produce coconut milk by squeezing the liquid from the grated endosperm. Coconut milk is popularly used in many dishes from Southeast Asia.

## Varieties

West Coast Tall Coconut: This tall coconut tree bears fruit in 6-7 years and produces around 60-80 coconuts per palm, each year. It is drought-tolerant, and the color of the fruits varies from green to yellow and orange to brown.

The East Coast Tall coconut: East coast tall produces around 60-70 coconuts on each palm every year and takes 6-8 years to yield fruits. This tall coconut tree needs well-drained, loamy soil to thrive.

Maypan Coconut: Hybrid of Malayan and Panama; Maypan is a cold-hardy variety, producing medium to large-sized coconuts. Growing up to 20-meters, this variety is also resistant to lethal yellowing disease.

Tiptur Tall Coconut: Leathery fronds of tiptur tree produce 6-12 inches long fruits. It starts bearing fruits in 6-7 years from the planting and produces 70-80 coconuts on each palm, every year. It is one of the best coconut tree variety to grow.

Orange Dwarf Coconut: Producing fruits in 3-4 years, this dwarf variety can yield around 50-70 drupes per palm each year. Each crown of this tree consists of 20-28 leaves. Avoid growing this palm tree in the wind prone areas, as it may get damaged due to strong winds.

Green Dwarf Coconut: This palm tree yields around 60-70 coconuts per palm and begins fruiting in 3-4 years. Its drupes are dark green and resistant to root wilt disease.

Malayan Yellow Dwarf Coconut: This palm has a yield of 50-60 coconuts on each palm per year and starts bearing fruits after 3-4 years. It is native to Indonesia and is resistant to lethal yellowing disease.

Fiji Dwarf Coconut: This tropical ornamental tree is popular for its long fronds and a swollen trunk base. Its unique leaf arrangement makes it different from others and has a large bulb at its lower stem. Thanks to its durable nature, it has earned the name- Tough nut.

Other coconut varieties include, VHCI coconut, Macapuno coconut and King coconut.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

The coconut palm is a tropical plant and is generally grown in humid, tropical regions. It grows optimally in areas with an annual mean temperature of 27°C (80.6°F) with in excess of 2000 hours of sunlight per year. The palm will thrive in a wide range of soils from sand to clay as long as they are well draining and well aerated with a pH between 4.3 and 8.0. Although palms are often found growing on sandy beaches, they can be successfully grown inland but will not tolerate freezing temperatures.

### Growing from Seed

Coconut palms are propagated exclusively from seed. The seeds are ready for planting when the coconut milk can be heard sloshing around inside the seed when it is shaken. Seeds are germinated by planting in seed beds before transferring to a polythene bag or nursery beds after germination. Seeds should be planted on their sides in a shallow hole with enough soil to cover about one third of the seed. The seed should be watered regularly to prevent it drying out. Germination usually occurs after about 3 months but may take up to 6 months.

Coconut seedling can be transplanted from 6 months onwards or transferred to pots and grown further in the nursery. Trees require a wide spacing and are typically planted 8–9 m (26–30 ft) apart allowing a further 8–9 m (26–30 ft) between rows. Dwarf varieties can be spaced closer together and are typically planted 7.5 m (25 ft) apart allowing another 7.5 m (25 ft) between rows

### General Care and Maintenance

The nuts ripen during the entire year. As a rule, a harvest is carried out every 1-2 months, when the ripened coconuts are harvested directly from the tree - farmers should not wait until the nuts fall from the tree. The nuts are fully ripened when the coconut water can be clearly heard sloshing against the inside when they are shaken. Harvesting too early can unfavorably affect the quality of the copra.

### Harvesting

Stock plants that are suitable seed providers produce 100 nuts per year and up to 180 g copra per nut. In drier areas yields are usually 15-20 nuts/tree/year. Harvest fully-ripened nuts intended to provide seeds after 11-12 months. Cut down nuts and lower them carefully (e.g.by rope). Do not allow the nuts to fall down. Following the harvest, store nuts for a short break in a covered, well- ventilated place.

### Drying

### Sun drying

Remove the husk first. Dry nuts on a clean surface to reduce moisture from 45% to 6%. In fine weather this takes about 5 days. Turn the pieces occasionally and cover them at night and in rainy weather.

### Kiln drying

Make a fire in the pit of the kiln. Use the coconut shells as fuel as they heat well and smoke little. Put the copra on a wire mesh platform over the fire and protect it from the rain. This takes about 4 days.

# Cocoyam

## Description

Cocoyams are herbaceous perennial plants belonging to the family Araceae and are grown primarily for their edible roots, although all parts of the plant are edible. Cocoyams that are cultivated as food crops belong to either the genus Colocasia or the genus Xanthosoma and are generally comprised of a large spherical corm (swollen underground storage stem), from which a few large leaves emerge. The petioles of the leaves stand erect and can reach lengths in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft). The leaf blades are large and heart-shaped and can reach 50 cm (15.8 in) in length. The corm produces lateral buds which give rise to tubers or cormels and suckers or stolons. Cocoyams commonly reach in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and although they are perennials, they are often grown as annuals, harvested after one season. Colocasia species may also be referred to as taro, old cocoyam, arrowroot, eddoe, macabo or dasheen and originates from Southeast or Central Asia. Xanthosoma species may be referred to as tannia, yautia, new cocoyam or Chinese taro and originates from Central and South America.

## Uses

Cocoyam is most commonly grown for its starchy edible roots. Colocasia is grown for its corm which is consumed after boiling, frying or roasting. The corms can be dried and used to make flour or sliced and fried to make chips. The leaves of the plant are also edible and are usually consumed as a vegetable after cooking in dishes such as stews. Xanthosoma species produce tubers much like potato and are boiled, baked, steamed or fried prior to consumption. The corm of some varieties is also consumed. Young leaves are eaten as a vegetable.Basic requirements

Cocoyam grows best in fertile, well-draining, sandy loam soil with a pH between 4.2–7.5.It can be grown in a wide variety of conditions including paddies in wetland areas using a system similar to that of rice. Xanthosoma species require temperatures above 21°C (69.8°F) to grow properly. Unlike Colocasia spp, they will not tolerate waterlogging and grow best in deep, well-draining loams with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5 in partial shade. Cocoyam will thrive when planted in full sunlight or partial shade. The plants can survive for short periods at temperatures of 10°C (50°F) but will be damaged or killed by lower temperatures.

## Propagation

Cocoyam is vegetatively propagated from headsetts (“tops”) or suckers which establish quickly and give the highest rate of survival. Larger headsetts and suckers tend to produce larger corms and bigger yeilds but the size of the planting material may be determined by the particular cultivar being grown e.g. some varieties will produce two heads from the same corm if the sucker that is planted is too big and therefore medium sized suckers are selected when growing tubers for export. Headsetts and suckers should only be taken from healthy plants in order to protect yields and prevent the spread of diseases.

### Planting

Cocoyam is planted in such a way as to encourage sucker growth e.g. the use of larger plant spacing and shallow planting depths. The planting material (sucker or headsett) is set in furrows or ridges and plant spacing can be anywhere between 30 to 100 cm (11.8–39.4 in) between plants depending on the prevailing soil and climatic conditions. A narrow spacing helps to control weeds whereas a wider spacing is preferred for good growth.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Alomae-bobone Colocasia bobone disease virus (CBDV)

- Symptoms: Leaves thickened, rolled and often brittle; leaf veins are prominent and develop enations; leaf petioles are shortened and also develop enations; plant may recover (bobone disease) Leaves thickened and dark green in color; distorted areas may develop on leaves and leaves may be cupped (but not rolled as in bobone disease); usually only one to three leaves affected (alomae disease)

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Taro plants have been traditionally classified as 'male' or 'female' based on their susceptibility to two diseases, both of which are caused by Colocasia bobone disease virus (CBDV), which are known as bobone and alomae; 'male' plants are susceptible to alomae and die as a result of the infection, but are resistant to bobone; 'female' plants are resistant to alomae but susceptible to bobone from which they recover; the virus is transmitted by leafhoppers

- Management: Management Remove any plants showing symptoms of disease and destroy by burning; removal of outer leaf sheaths may control the disease by reducing the number of leafhopper eggs

#### Dasheen mosaic Dasheen mosaic virus (DsMV)

- Symptoms: Mosaic pattern on leaves; mild to moderately distorted leaves

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Transmitted by aphids; symptoms more pronounced in cooler temperatures; infected plants may show no symptoms of disease fro several months after infection

- Management: Management The best method of control appears to be planting resistant varieties

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Phyllosticta leaf spot Phyllosticta colocasiophila

- Symptoms: Oval or irregular beige to reddish brown spots on leaves; dark brown spots with chlorotic area around lesion; holes in leaves where lesion centers have dried and dropped out

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favored by cloudy, rainy weather

- Management: Management No control is needed unless the disease is causing severe defoliation of the plants; remove and destroy any diseased leaves

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Phytophthora leaf blight Phytophthora colocasiae

- Symptoms: Small purple or dark brown, circular, water-soaked lesions on leaves which enlarge, turn purple-brown and may coalesce; lesions may exude clear amber fluid from center; lesions may from concentric pattern and develop white fuzz on both sides of leaves; holes may form in leaves where lesions have dried and dropped out; leaves collapse and die; disease may occur as a post-harvest rot of corms and causes large areas of dark gray to blue rot with indistinct margins

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Disease emergence favored by rainy overcast weather with low night temperatures; disease spread primarily by splashing rain water

- Management: Management Planting resistant varieties is the most effective method of controlling the disease; if plants do become infected, symptomatic leaves should be removed and destroyed to reduce the level of inoculum; plant cocoyam in well-draining soils; disease may also be controlled by protective sprays of appropriate systemic or non-systemic fungicides where available

#### Pythium root and corm rot Pythium spp.

- Symptoms: Soft, mushy rot on corm with foul odor; root system may be completely destroyed; plants stunted with shortened leaf stalks; leaves curled, crinkled and yellowish in color; when corm is cut open rotted area is sharply delineated from healthy tissue

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Disease emergence appears to favor the presence of warm, stagnant water where cocoyam is grown in wetlands; poor field sanitation practices aid in the spread of the disease

- Management: Management Some varieties are more resistant to the disease than others (e.g. Hawaiian varieties Kai Kea and Kai uliuli) and should be planted if disease is known to be a problem in the area; root rot severity can be reduced in acid soils by the addition of the fungicide Captan prior to planting


# Coffee

## Description

Coffee is grown in over 60 countries in the world, with the majority of the crop being produced in Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. Other major African coffee-producing countries include Uganda, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, and Kenya, with the crop serving as a significant source of income for many farmers and an export commodity for many countries.

The coffee plant has a woody perennial evergreen shrub or small tree that can grow up to 30 feet (9 meters) tall in the wild, although it is usually pruned to a height of 6–10 feet (1.8–3 meters) to make it easier to manage for cultivation. The plant has a straight trunk, elliptical leaves, and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. After the flowers are pollinated, the fruit, known as a coffee cherry, develops. Each cherry usually contains two seeds, which are the coffee beans that are harvested and roasted to make the coffee beverage. It takes 2 to 3 years for a coffee plant to mature and start producing berries, and it can continue to produce coffee berries for up to 25 years under good conditions.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Coffea

Common Name: Spanish: café, French: café, German: Kaffee, Italian: caffè, Portuguese: café, Dutch: koffie, Swedish: kaffe, Kahawa (Swahili).

## Uses & Benefits

Coffee has a variety of uses beyond being a popular beverage. It is often used as an ingredient in cooking and baking, adding a rich and complex flavor to dishes. Coffee is also commonly used in the production of chocolate and is a key ingredient in espresso-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. In addition to its culinary uses, coffee has non-culinary uses as well. For example, coffee grounds can be used as a natural exfoliant in beauty products or as a deodorizer in the home. The caffeine in coffee is also used in some medications and cosmetics, as it has stimulating properties. Furthermore, coffee has been shown to have a variety of health benefits, including improving cognitive function and reducing the risk of certain diseases. Overall, coffee is a versatile and valuable commodity that has a range of uses beyond just being a beverage.

## Varieties

The two main coffee varieties are Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffea canephora).

Arabica is the most widely consumed and accounts for approximately 60% of the world's coffee production. Arabica coffee is grown at high altitudes, typically above 2,000 feet (600 meters) above sea level, and is known for its delicate and complex flavor profile. Its berries have a smoother, sweeter taste, with notes of fruit, berries, chocolate, and nuts. They also have a lower caffeine content compared to robusta beans, which makes them a popular choice among coffee enthusiasts.

On the other hand, robusta coffee beans are known for their strong and bitter taste, higher caffeine content, and lower acidity. The plants can grow at lower altitudes, typically between 900 and 1200 feet above sea level, and are generally more disease-resistant and easier to cultivate compared to arabica. It has a shallow root system and grows as a shrub tree to almost 10 meters tall and has evenly distributed flowers. It takes 10 to 11 meters for the cherries to ripen, though this ripening is determined by the rainfall distribution. Robusta beans are commonly used in espresso blends and instant coffees due to their strong flavor profile and affordability.

In Uganda, a number of varieties have been developed by the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO), and close to 10 varieties of coffee that are high-yielding and resistant to coffee wilt have been released. These run from KR1 to KR10 (KR is an abbreviation for Kituza Robusta).

Other coffee varieties include:

Liberica: A coffee variety that is grown primarily in West Africa and Southeast Asia. Liberica beans have a unique flavor profile that is often described as smoky and woody with a floral aftertaste. They are known for their large size and irregular shape.

Excelsa: A coffee variety that is grown primarily in Southeast Asia. Excelsa beans have a tart and fruity flavor with hints of dark chocolate and a floral aroma. They are often used to add complexity to coffee blends.

Maragogype: A coffee variety that is grown primarily in Central and South America. Maragogype beans are very large and have a distinctive flavor that is often described as mild and nutty.

Catuai: A hybrid coffee variety that is a cross between Caturra and Mundo Novo. Catuai beans are grown primarily in Central and South America and are known for their high yield and balanced flavor profile.

Bourbon: A coffee variety that is grown primarily in Central and South America and Africa. Bourbon beans have a sweet and fruity flavor with a bright acidity and are often used in specialty coffee blends.

These are just a few examples of the many different coffee varieties that exist. Each variety has its own unique flavor profile and characteristics, and they are often used in different ways in the coffee industry.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Growing coffee requires specific climatic, soil, and water conditions. It is a tropical crop that thrives in areas with warm temperatures, abundant rainfall, and well-drained soil. The ideal temperature range for coffee growth is between 60-70°F (15-24°C). Heat stress can be caused by temperatures above 86 °F (30 °C), while temperatures below 50 °F (10 °C) can damage the coffee cherries. In terms of rainfall, coffee plants require a lot of water but also need well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The ideal rainfall range for coffee growth is between 1200mm and 1800mm, well distributed over a period of nine months, with consistent rainfall throughout the growing season.

The soil type and quality are also important factors in coffee production. Coffee plants require nutrient-rich soil with good drainage, a slightly acidic pH level (between 5.5 and 6.5), and good aeration. The soil should also be deep enough to allow the roots to penetrate and access water and nutrients. Additionally, coffee plants grow best in areas with high levels of organic matter, which can be provided through the use of compost or other organic fertilizers.

Water is also a critical factor in coffee production. Coffee plants require consistent access to water throughout the growing season, with frequent watering during dry spells. However, the soil must also be well-drained to prevent waterlogging, which can cause root rot and other diseases. In some areas, irrigation systems may be necessary to ensure that the plants receive adequate water.

Overall, the climatic, soil, and water conditions for growing coffee must be carefully managed to ensure a successful harvest and high-quality cherries.

### Growing from Seed

The land must be cleared of any existing vegetation, rocks, and other debris. The soil should then be tilled to a depth of at least 30 cm to loosen and aerate it. High-quality coffee seedlings should be selected from a reputable nursery or developed from seeds. Seedlings should be healthy, disease-free, and at least six months old. Holes should be dug at least 60 cm (2 feet) deep and 60 cm (2 feet) wide enough to accommodate the root ball of the seedling. The holes should be 3 meters apart. Seedlings should be carefully placed in the center of the hole. The soil in the hole should be uniformly mixed with well decomposed manure to boost growth and root establishment. Pest and disease-free seedlings should be selected.

### General Care and Maintenance

Mulching: This is the covering of topsoil between the coffee trees. A layer of organic mulch, such as dry leaves or grass, coffee husks, composted manure, maize stalks, and rice stalks, should be applied around the base of the seedling to help retain moisture and suppress weed growth. Mulching regulates soil moisture, controls soil erosion, and helps retain water.

Watering: The newly planted seedlings should be watered immediately and regularly to ensure that the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. In dry spells or when the rains aren't regular, water bottle irrigation should be used, as this is the cheapest of all.

Pruning: At a later stage, when the plant has grown, pruning should be done to remove any weak, dead, unproductive, diseased, and broken branches and promote the growth of a strong central stem. Pruning reduces competition for nutrients and sunlight on the stem or plant and removes unproductive parts to help the plant grow vigorously. It should be carried out at the end of the harvesting season, just before flowering takes place.

Fertilization: Regular fertilization is necessary to provide the coffee plants with the nutrients they need to grow and produce high-quality cherries.

Other maintenance practices: Coffee plants require regular maintenance, including pest and disease control weeding, planting shade trees around the garden, planting cover crops within the plantation, irrigation, and thinning to ensure healthy growth and optimal yields.

### Harvesting

Coffee is typically harvested by hand, which involves picking the ripe coffee cherries from the coffee plants. This can be accomplished through the use of either selective or strip-picking methods.

Selective picking: involves going through the coffee fields and picking only the ripe coffee cherries. This is typically done in several phases, as the coffee cherries do not all ripen at the same time. The picker will gently pull the ripe cherry from the tree, taking care not to damage the surrounding branches or unripe cherries.

Strip picking: Also known as "milking," this is the complete removal of all the berries from the coffee tree at once. It can be done manually with hands or with machinery that shakes the tree and knocks off all of the cherries. However, strip picking is discouraged since it involves mixing mature and ripe cherries with immature and unripe ones, leading to ununiform drying and eventually reducing the taste and quality of the final product.

After harvesting, the coffee cherries are processed to remove the outer layers and reveal the coffee cherries inside. There are two main processing methods, which are dry processing and wet processing.

Dry processing: This is the drying of harvested coffee cherries under the sun. Solar dryers, cement floors, tarpaulins, and raised tables are used. In Uganda, for example, this process takes 2–4 weeks, depending on the weather conditions. The dried coffee is now called "kiboko," and it should be free of dust, mold, and a bad smell with a recommended moisture content of 13–14% before being taken to the milling machine. At the machine, the outer cover is removed from the inner beans. The outer cover is now coffee husks, and the dried beans are now called "clean coffee" or "FAQ," which means fair to average quality. This is then graded to different screen sizes and packed for storage, export, or value addition.

Wet Processing: Coffee processed using this method usually fetches high prices because it's of a higher quality than the one under dry harvesting; however, this process is more complicated and requires specific tools to run it. The processing can be a full wash or a semi-wash. In a full wash, the skin of the freshly harvested berries is removed either manually or using a pulling machine with the addition of water. Mucilage (the sugary coating) is fermented for 2–3 days, and the parchment is washed to remove all the fermented mucilage. The parchment is dried to attain the recommended 12–13% moisture content. To dry 1 kg of fresh berries, 5 to 10 liters of water are required, as well as good management in washing and fermenting to ensure that the flavor is not lost in the process.

In a semi-wash, the fresh skin is physically removed using a pulling machine with the addition of water to avoid damaging the fabric. The mucin is then immediately removed with a mucin machine. No fermentation is done here. Once the mucilage is removed, the berries are now ready for drying to attain a moisture content of 12 to 13%. This process is faster than the full wash and uses less water—usually 0.5 to 1 liter for 1 kg of fresh cherries. However, it is not commonly used since a lot of expensive machines are used. It usually takes 7–12 days to dry the parchment coffee. This must be properly dried to avoid the growth of mold, rotting, and aflatoxins. Usually, farmers under this system use raised wire meshes under a shade to avoid direct sunlight from cracking the beans. 12–13% moisture content should be maintained, and the coffee shouldn't be put in bare grounds or dirty environments.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial blight Pseudomonas syringae

- Symptoms: Water-soaked spots on leaves which dry out and become brown and necrotic with yellow halos; necrosis of shoot tips which spreads rapidly down branches; leaves turn black and die off but remain attached to tree

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease can be spread long distance by the movement of infected seedlings or within the field by water splash; bacteria can enter the plant through wounds

- Management: Management Protective sprays of copper should be applied to the plants just before the onset of the rainy season and should be continued right through to the short rains

### Disease Category: Other

#### Cercospora leaf spot (Brown eye spot, Berry blotch) Cercospora coffeicola

- Symptoms: Brown spots on foliage which enlarge and develop gray-white center and a red- brown margin; lesions may also be surrounded by a yellow halo or may have a burned appearance if lesions are very numerous; infected leaves may drop from plant prematurely; lesions on green berries are brown and sunken and may have a purplish halo; infected red berries may have large black sunken areas

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease can be spread by wind, water-splash and through human movement through fields, particularly when plants are wet

- Management: Management Ensure crop is adequately fertilized as nutrient deficient plants are more susceptible to the disease; remove all crop debris from filed after pruning to prevent build up of inoculum; good plant spacing and pruning to open up the canopy promotes good air circulation around foliage and protects against disease; if disease does occur then it can be controlled with the use of copper fungicides where available

#### Coffee leaf rust Hemileia vastatrix

- Symptoms: Small, pale yellow spots on upper leaf surfaces followed by powdery orange- yellow lesions on the undersides of leaves; symptoms commonly develop on lower leaves of plant first and then spread; infected leaves drop from the plant and twigs and branches become defoliated

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: History Origins and spread Coffee originates from high altitude regions of Ethiopia, Sudan and Kenya and the rust pathogen is believed to have originated from the same mountains. The earliest reports of the disease hail from the 1860s. It was reported first by a British explorer from regions of Kenya around Lake Victoria in 1861 from where it is believed to have spread to Asia and the Americas. Rust was first reported in the major coffee growing regions of Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) in 1867 and the causal fungus was first fully described by the English mycologist Michael Joseph Berkeley and his collaborator Christopher Edmund Broome after an analysis of specimens of a “coffee leaf disease” collected by George H.K. Thwaites in Ceylon. Berkeley and Broome named the fungus Hemileia vastatrix , Hemileia referring to the half smooth characteristic of the spores and vastatrix for the devastating nature of the disease. It is unknown exactly how the rust reached Ceylon from Ethiopia but over the years that followed, the disease was recorded in India in 1870, Sumatra in 1876, Java in 1878, and the Philippines in 1889. During 1913 it crossed the African continent from Kenya to the Congo, where it was found in 1918, before spreading to West Africa, the Ivory Coast (1954), Liberia (1955), Nigeria (1962-63) and Angola (1966). The collapse of the coffee industry in Ceylon In the nineteenth century, Ceylon was one of the largest coffee producing regions in the world, responsible for the export of approximately 42 million kilos of coffee per year. In the 28 years following the arrival of rust, export ceased and production was reduced to less than 3 kg/year. It wasn’t until 1879 that the government of Ceylon set up a commission to investigate the crisis and the British government sent Harry Marshall Ward to the plantations. Ward’s work on the coffee rust fungus would establish him as one of the most important figures in the field of plant pathology. Ward was able to link the collapse of the coffee crop to the Hemileia vastatrix fungus and, identify characteristics of both the fungal spore and agricultural practices that caused such a catastrophic loss. Unfortunately the investigation came too late and the rust epidemic was too far advanced. Ward could do little other than document the complete collapse of the coffee crop, as has been recounted in many histories of the disease (Large, 1940, Carefoot and Sprott 1967, Money 2007). Ward’s observations however, would provide the crucial basis for the development of future control strategies, discussed below. Biology and ecology of coffee rust The collapse of the Sri Lankan coffee industry and Ward’s investigation of the agricultural practices being employed highlighted the problems created by planting coffee at such high densities. The proximity of the plants to one another created optimal conditions for rust transmission over short distances while the reduced genetic diversity resulting from the practice of monoculture meant that once the rust pathogen broke down the inherent host resistance, little could be done to prevent its spread. The pathogen, Hemileia vastatrix , evolved within the forest and adapted to the widely dispersed nature of the wild host by producing highly mobile spores that are capable of travelling large distances via wind currents, water splash and on the bodies of insects. The practice of removing native trees to plant coffee side by side, removed a natural barrier to the movement of the rust spores and helped compound the catastrophic crop losses witnessed in Ceylon. Rust transmission and infection Coffee leaf rust is an obligate parasite and is transmitted when urediniospores (spores produced from the brown-red rust pustules) disperse from one part of the plant to another, or to a new, uninfected plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the leaf from uredinia which make up part of the red/orange pustules on the undersides of the leaves. When the spores erupt, they enter the air current where they can travel a few centimeters to the next leaf, or hundreds of kilometers to another site (spores have been recorded travelling 1,000 m up in the high altitude air streams). The spores are also known to travel over shorter distances by rain- splash, which is a common way for plant pathogens to travel from leaf to leaf of the same tree. There are also documented cases of spores being transported to new sites by small insects such as Thrips and parasitoid wasps. When the spores reach a leaf, they attach to the surface using the spines on their rough side. In order for the spores to germinate, they require the presence of liquid water on the leaves and a temperature of 17 to 25°C (62.6 to 77°F), with 22°C (71.6°F) being optimal. Heavy rains can wash the spores from the leaves and prevent infection occurring. When conditions are favorable, the spores produce a long tubes known as germ tubes which move over the leaf searching for a stomata (tiny openings in the leaf surface where plants breathe and release water). The germ tubes produce appressoria (flattened fungal structures that produce ‘pegs’ to puncture through host tissues) on, or close to the stomata, from which infection hyphae grow and puncture the host cells. The entire infection process is completed in 24 to 48 hours and new urediniospores erupt from the stomatal openings after 10 to 14 days. One rust lesion will produce 4–6 spore crops over a 3–5 month period releasing 300–400,000 spores into the environment to repeat the process. The 2012 Coffee leaf rust epidemic In 2012 there was a major increase in coffee rust across ten Latin American and Caribbean countries. The disease became an epidemic and the resulting crop losses pushed coffee prices to an all time high amid concerns for supply. The reasons for the epidemic remain unclear but an emergency rust summit meeting in Guatemala in April 2013 compiled a long list of shortcomings. These included a lack of resources to control the rust, the dismissal of early warning signs, ineffective fungicide application techniques, lack of training, poor infrastructure and conflicting advice. In a keynote talk at the “Let’s Talk Roya” meeting (El Salvador, November 4th 2013), Dr Peter Baker, a senior scientist at CAB International, raised several key points regarding the epidemic including the proportional lack of investment in research and development in such a high value industry and the lack of investment in new varieties in key coffee producing countries such as Colombia.

- Management: Management Resistant varieties Commercially grown coffee has, through the practice of monocultures, lost much of the genetic diversity of its wild ancestors. Sadly, due to the effects of deforestation, wild coffee has also lost much of its genetic diversity outside of its evolutionary center in Ethiopia. The breeding of crop varieties which are resistant to key pathogens has proven to be a very successful method of controlling diseases and inIn the late 1950s, a natural coffee hybrid was discovered growing wild in East Timor. The plant was found to be a hybrid of C. arabica and C. canephora and was named Hibrído de Timor (HDT). The plant was found to possess full or partial resistance to all known races of the rust pathogen and five genes were subsequently elucidated from the hybrid and from other coffee varieties that were responsible for conferring the resistance Varieties expressing some of these genes have been grown commercially but the the resistance was broken- down after a few years when new virulent races of the rust pathogen emerged. Crosses of the hybrid with other commercial cultivars produced the ‘Colombia’ cultivar which is now widely planted. Colombia managed to reduce its losses during the 2012/13 epidemic because of new plantings. Many Colombian farmers are now replanting with Castillo or Colombia varieties. Fungicides Copper- containing fungicides Copper-containing fungicides remain one of the most effective and economical methods of controlling the rust pathogen in susceptible coffee varieties and during conditions which are favorable to the development of rust. They have the added advantage of being active against a number of other fungal pathogens and have also been shown to increase coffee yields. Examples of copper-containg fungicides used in coffee include copper oxychloride and cuprous oxide which have largely replaced the use of Bordeaux mixture in most commercial plantations. These chemicals are applied protectively with plants being sprayed in advance of infection and work by adhering to the plant and producing a toxic barrier to invading fungal pathogens. They pose limitations due to their need to be reapplied at regular intervals to protect new growth flushes and also pose environmental concerns over the accumulation of copper to toxic levels in the soil. Copper-containing fungicides can be alternated with systemic fungicides to reduce the amount of copper build-up. Systemic fungicides Systemic fungicides used in coffee include pyracarbolids such as triadimefon and propiconazole and strobilurins such as azoxystrobin. Systemic fungicides are transported around the plant in the vascular tissue after application thus requiring lower doses and less frequent application than copper-based fungicides. They can be applied after infection has occurred to treat the symptoms of the disease and eradicate it from the host plant. Systemic fungicides tend to be more expensive and some have been shown to induce severe defoliation of the coffee plant. They have been shown to be very effective at controlling rust when used in combination with copper-containing fungicides. Organic fungicides Only one organic fungicide is widely used in coffee - triadimefon. Triadimefon is a systemic fungicide which is applied to the foliage and works to inhibit the rust infection. It can be alternated or combined with other chemicals and is generally very effective at controlling rust infections. Organically certified control methods Most commercially grown coffee varieties are susceptible to coffee rust fungus and because organic farmers cannot use chemical approaches controlling the rust is extremely hard. (note that in some growing regions copper based fungicides are allowed). Here we discuss a few methods and we encourage others to share knowledge by emailing PlantVillage or answering questions on the forum. i) Planting spore traps. The fungal spore has a rough side that attaches to plant tissue. Wind-break trees can be used to reduce the spore load. Organic coffee is often grown using shade trees which may act to reduce inoculum reaching the coffee plants. ii) Spraying organic formulations that impacts the ability of the spore to germinate or of new spores to be produced. We have heard that some farmers had success with this strategy but we do not know the details. Dr Peter Baker of CABI has reported to us that some farmers are using lime sulphur because of the expense of copper. We will try and find more information. Please contact PlantVillage if you have information. iii) Spraying water. It is feasible that high pressure water can wash the spores from the leaves and reduce the spore load. Heavy rains may also have the same effect. As humidity on the leaves actually promotes fungal growth then washing is best done when the water is likely to evaporate. Biological control Concepts Biological control is the use of one living organism to control another living organism that is considered a pest species. In addition to breeding new and better genetic material and the use of good crop husbandry, the development of an effective biological control strategy could provide another tool to manage coffee rust which would allow for organic certification and the continued use of heirloom varieties. If a suitable agent(s) can be identified in the short term, then this approach would be available in significantly less time than that needed to develop a new variety. CBC of fungi exploits the ability of coevolved fungal natural enemies in order to produce massive quantities of inoculum on the host plant and allow them to spread and propagate continuously within the host population. It offers a sustainable control method but has and has, surprisingly, never been used for crop pathogens (diseases). The concept is simple and follows the enemy-release hypothesis whereby an exotic or alien species increases its fitness, and hence its invasiveness, because it arrives without its guild of co-evolved natural enemies. Examples i) Bacteria Bacteria such as Bacillus and Pseudomonas are known to produce compounds that negatively affect fungal pathogens of plants. Such bacteria evolved in the soil and utilize antifungal compounds to compete with soil dwelling fungi. A number of studies have shown how coffee rust development in greenhouse settings or in the lab can be retarded by Bacillus and Pseudomonas . For example, a study by Haddad et al, 2009 showed for the first time that certain strains of< i>Bacillus and Pseudomonas reduced coffee rust on organic farms in Brazil. In follow up work the same team (Haddad et al 2014) found 17 different bacterial isolates collected from leaves, leaf debris, and soil reduced both the infection frequency and the number of H. vastatrix urediniospores produced per leaf by more than 70%. ii) Other fungi White halo fungus, Lecanicillium lecanii , has been suggested as a potential biological control agent of coffee rust by Prof. John Vandermeer and collaborators at the University of Michigan (Vandermeer et al 2009). White halo fungus has been shown to be hyperparasitic on Hemileia vastatrix in laboratory conditions and it has also been observed attacking the fungus in the field. White halo fungus often infects green coffee scale which feed on coffee. These insects are frequently tended by ants which collect the sugar that they excrete. The ants often create clusters of scale insects on the plants which are infected with white halo disease. It is postulated that white halo fungus may attack and kill the coffee leaf rust fungus or may simply reduce its abundance due to crowding effects or produce chemicals to attack it. Currently, the fungus does not appear be a viable biological control agent because it has not evolved to parasitize the fungi, rather it evolved to infect insects. Promising attempts have been made to culture the fungus and apply it as a topical spray to control the rust fungus. Future prospects Currently, no CBC program has focused explicitly on controlling coffee rust but pathogenic rusts have themselves been used to control other pests. For example, rubber vine is considered to be a major pest plant in Australia as it is highly invasive and causes millions of dollars of damage to agriculture and massive ecological damage. A team led by Dr. Harry Evans, a scientific officer with CAB International, identified a rust called Maravalia (which is taxonomically close to coffee rust) in the center of genetic origin for rubber vine in Madagascar which showed potential for use as a CBC agent. Before the rust could be released in the environment in Australia, it had to be quarantined. This process removed the rust from its natural enemies and had the effect of making the rust fungus extremely pathogenic. Dr. Evan’s stated that the rust went ‘berserk’ and when it was eventually deployed in Australia, it was extremely successful at controlling the rubber vine, even killing off young seedlings. In 2014, another team led by Dr. Evans and Dr. Roberto Barretto of the Federal University of Vicosa in Brazil will begin to explore genetic centers of origin of Arabica coffee with the aim of identifying similar co-evolved natural enemies of Hemileia vastatrix . It is believed that CBC holds great promise for the future control of coffee rust.

# Collard greens

## Description

Collards, Brassica oleracea var viridis are herbaceous annual or biennial plants in the family Brassicaceae grown for their edible leaves which are consumed as a vegetable. Collards are erect, branched plants with thick stems and irregularly lobed dark green leaves with long petioles. The plant produces clusters of small yellow flowers on racemes. Collards can reach 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and are usually grown as annuals, harvested after one growing season. Collards may also be referred to as collard greens or tree cabbage and likely originated from a wild ancestor in ancient Asia minor.

## Uses

Collards leaves are usually consumed after cooking and are eaten as a leafy green vegetable.Basic requirements

Collard greens are a cool season crop that grow best in cool, moist conditions. The plant will grow best at temperatures between 4 and 21°C (40–50°F) allowing it to be grown in both Spring and Fall. Collards are very hardy and will tolerate frost. The plants will grow optimally in a rich, moist, well draining soil with a pH of 6.5. Collard greens requires at least six hours of direct sunlight every day.

### Sowing seeds

Collard greens can be direct seeded or started indoors for transplants. The optimum soil temperature for germination is between 12 and 24°C (55–75°F). Collard seeds should be planted after any danger of hard frost or in a cold frame for transplanting to their final location. For Fall harvest, plant collard seeds in July so that the plants develop in cooler weather. Prepare the soil for planting through the addition of nitrogen in the form of bone meal or composted manure. Plant seeds 6 mm (0.25 in) deep allowing 3.5 cm (1 in) between plants in the row, allowing 0.6–1.2 m (2–4 ft) between rows. Thin seedlings to a final within row spacing of 30–60 cm (12–24 in). Keep soil moist during germination to prevent a crust from forming on the soil surface as this will cause uneven germination.

### Transplanting

Seedlings started indoors or in a cold frame are ready to be transplanted when they have 5–6 true leaves. Seedlings should be planted at the final spacing for seeds (30–60 cm/12–24 in between plants and 0.6 to 1.2 m/2–4 ft between rows). Plant each seedling slightly deeper than it was previously. The plantings can be staggered in 2 week intervals to prolong the harvest.

General care and maintenance

Collards should be kept evenly watered, application of mulch around plants helps to conserve soil moisture. The plants have shallow roots and in order to avoid damaging them, it is preferable to hand pull any weeds growing around the plants. Collards are heavy feeders, requiring plentiful nitrogen to meet their growth requirements and develop optimally. Apply an appropriate complete fertilizer when thinning seedlings.

### Harvesting

Collard greens can be harvested about 2 months after planting. Harvest the outer leaves to avoid damaging the growing tip of the plant. Collard leaves are sweeter when they are harvested after frost..

# Coriander (Cilantro)

## Description

Coriander, Coriandrum sativum, is an erect annual herb in the family Apiaceae. The leaves of the plant are variable in shape, broadly lobed at the base of the plant, and slender and feathery higher on the flowering stems. It is a soft, hairless plant. The flowers are produced in small umbels and are white or very pale pink in color  with the petals pointing away from the centre of the umbel longer than those pointing towards it. The plant produces an oval shaped fruit which is yellow-brown in color and contains two seeds. Coriander is an annual plant, surviving only one growing season and reaches up to 50 cm (19.7 in). Coriander may also be referred to as cilantro, chinese parsley or dhania and originates from the Near East.

## Uses

All parts of the coriander plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are most commonly used. Leaves and seeds are used fresh or dried as a herb in cooking.Basic requirements

The plant grows optimally in areas with damp, cool springs and hot, dry summers at temperatures between 17 and 27°C (62.6–80.6°F) depending on the variety. The plant can tolerate light frost but hot temperatures will cause the plants to bolt. Coriander grows best in well-draining soil and can be grown in sandy loam, loam and clay soils as long as there is sufficient drainage. The plants will grow best when positioned in full sun.

## Propagation

Coriander is propagated directly from seeds and should be sown after the last frost. The seeds should be planted in a prepared bed by planting seeds 0.6 to 1.2 cm (0.25-0.5 in) deep allowing 5cm (2 in) between seeds and 30 to 38 cm (12-15 in) between rows. Plantings can be staggered to ensure a continuous harvest. The seeds should be kept moist.

General care and maintenance

Once the young coriander plants are established they require little water as the plants do not perform well in damp conditions. The plants should be kept free of weeds, particularly when they are young to prevent competition for nutrients. The plants will benefit from the addition of fertilizer during the growing season. Phosphorous and potassium often limit the growth of coriander whereas the demand for nitrogen is not very high.

### Harvest

Coriander can be harvested 45 to 70 days after planting. Leaves can be removed from the outside of the plant when they have reached 10 to 15 cm (4-6 in) in length. Commercially grown coriander is harvested by cutting the entire plant at soil level or 4 to 5 cm (1.5-2.0 in) above the crown, The bunches are then secured with a rubber band or tied together with a twist tie.

# Cotton

## Description

Cotton is the collective name given to four species of plants in the genus Gossypium, Gossypium hirsutum, Gossypium barbadense, Gossypium arboreum and Gossypium herbaceum which are perennial shrubs in the family Malvaceae grown for the fluffy fiber which protects the seeds of the plant. G. hirsutum accounts for approximately 90% of world wide cotton production today. Cotton plants possess a main stem giving rise to several branches at the top. The leaves of the plant are spirally arranged on the branches, have long petioles and have 3–5 triangular lobes.  The plant produces a single flower on each axillary branch which can be red-purple, yellow or white in color and forms a leathery, oval seed capsule, or 'boll' which is 2–6 cm (0.8–2.4 in) long. Mature bolls will usually split open to reveal the characteristic white cotton fibers and the seed.  The cotton plant can reach heights of 1–1.5 m (3.3–4.9 ft) and is usually cultivated as an annual, surviving only one growing season.  Cotton may also be referred to as tree cotton and its center of origin is unknown although the plant has diversified from Mexico, north-east Africa and Arabia and Australia.

## Uses

The major use of cotton today is in the textile industry, the fibers or 'lints' of the cotton plant are harvested and woven into fabric for the production of clothing, towels, bed sheets and many other textiles. Cotton fiber may also be used in the production of yarn and twine.  The cotton seeds can be used to extract oil for use in the production of shortening or cooking oil and the manufacture of soaps and lubricants.  The seed may be used as a feed for livestock. The fuzz produced as a byproduct of the ginning process can be used in the upholstery industry.Basic requirements

Cotton is best grown in desert conditions using irrigation. The seeds will germinate optimally at 34°C (93.2°F), while the seedlings requires a temperature between 24 and 29°C (75.2–84.2°F) to grow and develop properly. Cotton will grow on a variety of soils including sandy soil and heavy clay as long as it is water permeable and will grow optimally in a soil with a pH of 5.5–8.5. In addition cotton has a high tolerance for salt.

### Planting

Cotton is propagated from seed by planting directly in a prepared field when growing conditions are favorable (suitable temperature, adequate rainfall etc). Cotton should only be planted when the soil has warmed to at least 18.3°C (65°F). Generally, seeds should be sown at a depth of 0.25 cm (1 in), with 3–6 seed sown in each hole. Ridging the soil is recommended as it helps to drain the plant in wet conditions and also to conserve water in dry conditions. Plant spacing depends on the variety but generally 20–100 cm (7.9–39.4 in) should be left between plants.

General care and maintenance

The cotton field should be kept free from weeds and where the crop does not receive an adequate amount of water from rainfall, additional irrigation should be provided. Demand for nutrients is dependent on the type of soil on which the cotton is being grown. Cotton growing in acidic soils the plants will have a greater demand for nitrogen and phosphorus, whereas in sandy soil, potassium will be of greater importance. It is not recommended to grow cotton in the same field for more than three years and the crop should be rotated to prevent the build-up of diseases in the soil.

### Harvesting

Cotton is still picked by hand in many areas of the world where the crop is grown. In the US cotton is machine harvested. Cotton in ready to harvest approximately 4 months after sowing when the bolls split open to reveal the white cotton fibers. Fields are usually picked once every 3 to 4 weeks to prevent the fibers remaining in the field too long where they are susceptible to pests. The entire field is usually harvested with 2 to 3 pickings.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Alternaria leaf spot Alternaria macrospora

- Symptoms: Small, circular brown lesions on cotyledons and seedling leaves which expand and develop a concentric pattern; necrotic areas coalesce and often have a purple margin; centers of lesions may dry out and drop form the plant creating a "shot-hole" appearance on the leaves.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Plants stressed by drought, nutrient deficiency and other pests are more susceptible to the disease; fungus spreads rapidly in dense canopies, especially during periods of warm, wet weather.

Typically the infected leaves retain their green color or green yellow color. Under severe conditions leaf and flower drop may occur.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: The pathogen also infects cucumber, sweet potato, soybean and tomato. It will cause severe loss if pathogen infect at flowering stage. The disease is common in Southeastern cotton producing states of USA. The target spot is confused with leaf spot caused by Cercospora spp. Stemphyllium spp. or Alternaria spp. But this spot is surrounded by reddish to purplish margin.

- Management: Management Use available resistant varieties. Follow crop rotation. Spray suitable fungicide.

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial blight/angular leaf spot of cotton Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. malvacearum Earlier Xanthomonas citri ssp. malvacearum

- Symptoms: Water-soaked spots on leaves which are delimited by leaf veins, giving them an angular appearance; lesions increase in size and turn black and necrotic; leaves drop from the plant; disease may also cause elongated gray-black lesions extending from the leaves to petioles and stem which are known as the "blackarm" phase; severe blackarm symptoms may cause the stem to be girdled; water-soaked lesions may be present on bolls; boll lesions enlarge and become sunken and brown-black in color.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease if often introduced to cotton fields by infested seeds.

- Management: Management The use of resistant cotton varieties is the most effective method of controlling the disease; cultural practices such as plowing crop residue into soil after harvest can also limit disease emergence.


# Cowpea

## Description

Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata, is a climbing annual in the family Fabaceae grown for its edible seeds and pods. The cowpea plant is usually erect and possess ribbed stems and smooth trifoliate leaves which are arranged alternately on the stems. The plant produces clusters of flowers at the end of a peduncle (flower stalk) and 2–3 seed pods per peduncle. The seed pods are smooth, cylindrical and curved, reaching up to 35 cm (10 in) in length, with distinctive coloration, usually green, purple or yellow. As the seeds reach maturity the pod changes color to tan or brown. The seeds can be white, cream, green, red brown or black in color or be a mottled combination. The seed may also possess an ‘eye’ where a lighter color is surrounded by one that is darker. Cowpea can reach in excess of 80 cm (31.5 in) in height and, as an annual plant, lives for only one growing season before harvest. Cowpea may also be referred to as black-eyed pea, southern pea, crowder pea or field pea and originates from Africa.

## Uses

Cowpea is an important grain legume in Africa, parts of the Americas and in Asia. The seeds can be consumed fresh along with the pods and leaves as a vegetable. Dried seeds are consumed after cooking. The plant can be used as a forage or for hay or silage.Basic requirements

Cowpea is a warm season crop and thrives in hot, moist conditions. Cowpeas have similar growth requirements to soybeans and should not be planted until until after the last frost and only when the soil temperature has reached 18.3°C (65°F) to prevent seeds rotting in the ground. The plants will be killed by frost. Cowpeas can be planted in a wide range of soils, from acidic (to pH 4) to neutral, as long as they are well-draining but the plants are not well adapted to alkaline soil. For best results,plant cowpeas in a well draining sandy loam with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5 in an area that receives full sun. Cowpeas are drought resistant and very heat tolerant which means they can be grown successfully in many areas.

### Planting

Cowpeas should be direct seeded when the soil temperature is consistently above 18.3°C (65°F). Seeds should be sown to a depth of 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in) at a density of 4-8 plants per foot of row. An additional 76 cm (30 in) should be left between rows. Seeds germinate quickly and the plants should produce pods in approximately 60 days.

General care and maintenance

Cowpea is fast growing and should quickly suppress any competing weeds. Some perennial grass species may colonize the spaces between rows and should be removed by cultivation. Cowpeas can grow in poor quality soils and do not require the addition of nitrogen fertilizers. In addition, the plants can grow a taproot which is often in excess of 2.4 m (8 ft) which allows the plant to access moisture deep down in the soil. This makes cowpea extremely resistant to drought, requiring little or no irrigation after the plants have become established.

# Cranberry

## Description

Cranberry is the name given to a group of long-lived woody perennial shrubs or trailing vines in the genus Vaccinium, including Vaccinium macrocarpon, the most popular commercial species, grown for their edible berries. The cranberry bush possesses a slender, wiry stems with small elliptical waxy evergreen leaves 7–10 mm (0.28–0.45 in) in length. The plant produces distinctive dark pink flowers with reflexed petals that leave the style and stamens exposed.  The fruit is produced on the new plant growth produced that season and are initially white and ripen to dark red, waxy berries measuring 9–14 mm (0.4–0.6 in) in diameter. The cranberry plant can reach 5–20 cm (2.0–7.9 in) in height, with the vines stretching up to 2 m (6.6 ft) long.  The cranberry may also be referred to as bearberry and originates from North America.

## Uses

Cranberries are usually processed into juice, sauce, jam and sweetened dried cranberries. They may also eaten raw.  Cranberries have long been used as a remedy to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections, research has demonstrated the benefit to women, but the effect on other groups is less clear.Basic requirements

Cranberries are wetland plants which grow best in bogs, swamps and poorly draining soils. The plants grow best in acidic, organic or sandy soils with a pH between 4.0 and 5.5 where there is a plentiful water supply. The bed should have a base material which is impermeable to water such as clay or peat. Commercially grown cranberries are grown in large beds surrounded by dykes that hold water in the beds when flooded for harvest. Cranberry is very susceptible to frost and flooding is also used to protect the plants along with sprinkler irrigation. This means that it is the water that will freeze and the resultant heat produced by the change of liquid to solid (latent heat of fusion) protects the plants from freezing themselves. It is common for cranberry beds to be covered with up to 25 cm (9.8 in) of ice.

## Propagation

Cranberries are usually propagated vegetatively by moving vines to a new bed. Cuttings are obtained as a by product of the practice of mowing the beds. Mowing helps to prevent the vines from becoming matted and leads to greater productivity by promoting new growth. Cuttings are pushed into a layer of fresh sand approximately 15 cm (5.9 in) deep and the sand is kept moist to allow the new vines to establish and produce new growth. Fruit will be produced on the new vine within 2–3 years and full productivity should be reached within 4 to 6 years of planting. Rooted plants are available for planting in home gardens and are less labor intensive option.

General care and maintenance

One of the most important aspects of caring for cranberry plants is to protect them from frosts. Growers use irrigation systems to help prevent damage and are able to flood the beds to protect the plants. In the home garden, cranberry plants can be protected by covering with plastic sheets or blankets in the event of a frost. Cranberry beds should be kept moist through irrigation. Cranberries benefit from the addition of fertilizers with nitrogen being the most common requirement. Cranberries utilize nitrogen in the ammonium form as the lack the ability to reduce the nitrogen to nitrate. Phosphorous may also be required but should not be applied to the soil in excess amounts as acid soils bind large quantities of the element and it is unavailable to the plants.

### Harvest

Cranberries can be dry or wet harvested. Berries are dry harvested with the use of a machine which combs berries from the plants. Wet harvesting of berries occurs in many major cranberry growing regions and involves flooding the beds and using machinery to remove the berries from the vines. The beds are flooded with water sufficient to cover the vines and a piece of machine called a water reel, or “beater”, is driven through the bed to displace the berries from the plants. More water is then added to the beds to allow the berries to float free from the plants and they are then moved with the use of booms to one corner of the bed where they are removed by conveyor belts or pumps for transport and processing.

## Common Pests and Diseases

# Cress

## Description

Garden cress, Lepidium sativum, is an herbaceous annual in the family Brassicaceae grown for its edible shoots and leaves which are grown as a salad green.  Garden cress is a fast growing plant with many branches and narrow, oval leaves. The plant produces small pink to white flower which are 2 mm (1/12 in) in diameter and form a highly clustered inflorescence.  It can reach a height of 60 cm (23.6 in) and although classed as an annual it can behave as a perennial as it may drop seeds before harvest that will grow the next year.  Garden cress may also be referred to as pepper cress or Persian broadleaf cress and it originates from Persia (Iran).

## Uses

The shoots and leaves of garden cress are used as a salad green or seasoning as they has a peppery taste.  The seeds may also be ground and used as a seasoning.Basic requirements

Garden cress is a cool season annual and can grow in almost any type of soil as long as it is moist and rich in nutrients. Cress will grow best in a well-draining loam soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.7. The plants should be grown in full sun or partial shade in areas where temperatures get very high. Cress plants will tolerate some frost.

### Planting

Garden cress is propagated by seed and can be sown as soon as the soil is workable in the Spring. The seeds are sown either by broadcasting or arranging the plants in rows. Rows should be spaced 7-10 cm (3-4 in) apart. The seeds should be covered with a light layer of soil and kept moist. Cress will germinate in 2 to 7 days and the plants do not usually require thinning. The plants will grow best if the soil is kept moist.

General care and maintenance

Cress is very easy to grow and care for. The plants will grow best if kept moist so the plants should be watered regularly. Keep beds weed free to prevent competition with the developing plants. Due to its short growing period, cress has a low fertilizer requirement. Container grown plants can be fertilized with a liquid fertilizer if required.

### Harvesting

Cress can be harvested 2 to 3 weeks after the seedlings emerge once the leaves have reached 3 cm (2 in) in length. Harvest older plants first by snipping with a pair of scissors and leave the younger ones to develop fully.

# Cucumber

## Description

Cucumber, Cucumis sativus, is a warm season, vining, annual plant in the family Cucurbitaceae grown for its edible cucumber fruit.  The cucumber plant is a sprawling vine with large leaves and curling tendrils.  The plant may have 4 or 5 main stems from which the tendrils branch.  The leaves of the plant are arranged alternately on the vines, have 3–7 pointed lobes and are hairy. The cucumber plant produces yellow flowers that are 4 cm (1.6 in) in diameter.  The cucumber fruit varies in shape but is generally a curved cylinder rounded at both ends that can reach up to 60 cm (24 in) in length 10 cm (3.9 in) in diameter.  Cucumber plants are annual plants, surviving only one growing season and the vines can reach up to 5 m (16.4 ft) in length. Cucumber may also be referred to as gherkin and originates from the foothills of the Himalayas, likely in India.

## Uses

Although technically a fruit, cucumbers are used as a fresh vegetable, consumed fresh in salads.  Some varieties are grown specifically for pickling. Yellow varieties are generally cooked before consumption.Basic requirements

Cucumbers require warm, dry conditions to develop optimally, preferring both warm days and warm nights and growing best at a temperature of 30°C (86°F). Cucumbers will yield best if grown in a fertile, well-draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5. Cucumbers are very sensitive to cold and should be planted in  full sun and provided with ample soil moisture due to their shallow root system.

### Cucumber varieties

One of the biggest considerations when choosing a cucumber variety is whether or not it requires pollinating. Many newer cucumber varieties are gynoecious which means that they produce only, or mostly, female flowers. Some gynoecious varieties require pollinating with male flowers, in which case a proportion of the seeds in the packet will be pollinator plants which produce the male flowers. Some gynoecious varieties are parthenocarpic which means that they do not need the male plants to produce fruit. These types are recommended for growing in glasshouses as they do not require the presence of insect pollinators.

### Sowing seeds

Direct seeding is the preferred method for sowing cucumbers as they do not transplant well. Seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 15.6°C (60°F). Sow seeds 1.3–2.5 cm (0.5–1.0 in) deep, thinning to a spacing of at least 30 cm (12 in) between plants after germination. Cucumbers can also be seeded on hills or mounds of soil to encourage warm soil and better drainage. In this instance, seeds should be sown on hills in groups of 4–6 seeds, allowing 1.2 m (4 ft) between each group in all directions. After emergence, thin the seedlings to 1 or 2 plants per hill. Cucumber seeds should germinate in 4–13 days depending on the soil temperature.

General care and maintenance

Cucumber vines are sprawling and require plenty space to grow. Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence. Providing burpless varieties with vertical support allows the fruits to hang loose and grow straight. Cucumbers also require a continuous supply of water and where drip irrigation is not being used, plants should be watered deeply once per week, providing at least an inch of water. Shallow watering or watering less frequently will reduce fruit yields. Mulches can be used to conserve soil moisture and black plastic mulch has the advantage of warming the soil.

### Harvesting

Cucumbers should be harvested from the plant when they are still immature and green in color. Mature fruits are yellow and the flesh is often tough with woody seeds. The size of cucumbers at harvest depends on the variety of the cucumber being grown and what it is to be used for. Cucumbers for pickling are generally picked when they are less than 5 cm (2 in) long whereas burpless cucumbers for slicing should be allowed to reach  approximately 4 cm (~1.5 in) in diameter.  It is important to remove any fruits nearing maturity to ensure the plant remains productive. Their rapid growth means that cucumbers may need harvested every couple of days.

# Dates

## Description

The date palm, Phoenix dactylifera, is an erect palm tree in the family Arecaceae grown for its edible fruit, the date. The trunk of the tree is covered in upward-pointing, overlapping, woody leaf bases and terminates in a crown of 20–30 leaves. The leaves are feather-like with spiny petioles and thick midrib. The leaf blades are pinnately divided and are blue-green in color. The uppermost leaves of the crown stand more erect while the lower ones droop and recurve toward the trunk. The tree produces small, fragrant cream-white flowers and the inflorescence may possess as many as 10,000 flowers. The fruits are produced in clusters and are oblong to ovoid berries with single stones and red-brown flesh. Date palms can grow to a height of 30 m (98 ft) and can live for up to 150 years, although they are usually replaced in commercial plantations when their productivity begins to decline. The date palm is believed to originate from Western Asia.

## Uses

Dates are consumed as a fresh or dry fruit. They are considered a staple in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East. The fruit may also be used to make juice concentrates, fermented products (e.g. wines) or pastes for use in baking and confection.Basic requirements

Date palms grow best in semi-arid climates close to water bodies such as rivers or oases, with an annual average temperature of 12–27°C (53.6–80.6°F) in regions where there is a long hot summer and mild winter. A mean temperature of 21–30°C (69.8–86°F) for at least one month is necessary for fruit production in addition to a period of no rainfall during flowering to prevent damage to the flowers. Date palms grow well in a wide range of soils provided they are well-draining, have a pH between 5.2 and 8 and are in close proximity to a body of water. Fruit production is highest when grown in sandy loams.

## Propagation

Date palms for commercial cultivation are usually propagated from suckers removed from the base of mature trees to allows desirable characteristics to be maintained. The suckers should be between 3 and 6 years old and are separated from the mother along with some root. Separating of suckers is usually carried out in late summer of Fall. The newly detached suckers are planted to a depth of 80 cm (31.5 in) leaving 9–10 m (30–33 ft) between plants. The newly planted suckers should be watered daily for the first week to aid in establishment and once weekly thereafter.

### Pollination

Date palms are protandric which means that the male flowers are produced before the females. In order for successful pollination to be guaranteed, commercial date palms are pollinated by hand or with the use of machinery. Hand pollination is achieved by cutting the male inflorescence from the palm and joining strands to the female inflorescence. Alternatively, the pollen is extracted and mixed with flour and the mixture is then applied mechanically to the female flowers. Mechanical pollination is conducted with the aid of a small insecticide duster known as a ‘puffer’.

General care and maintenance

Date development is aided by removing dead leaves and thorns from the trees, thinning of fruit and bunches and also the removal of bunches if the number per palm is too high. Allowing palms to over produce will reduce yield the following year. Each of these practices also aims to maximize fruit size and promote regular fruit production. When bunches begin to develop, they are pulled down and tied to lower leaves in order to protect them from damage from wind. Dates require dry and hot conditions to ripen in combination with the large amount of irrigation of the soil.

### Harvesting

Harvesting of ripe dates requires reaching the top of the palm tree. This is achieved through the use of ladders which may be permanently fixed to the tree or through the use of machinery that can raise the worker on a platform. In the Northern Hemisphere, harvest begins at the end of the summer into early Fall and ends around November depending on the variety. Some varieties continue to be harvested after the onset of the rainy season but rain can damage the fruit and reduce its quality so the fruits are usually protected with the use of waxed paper or nylon sleeves.

# Dill

## Description

Dill, Anethum graveolens, is an herbaceous annual in the family Apiaceae grown for its leaves which are used as a herb. Dill is a very aromatic plant with an erect growth habit. It possess branching stems and fine, soft, fibre-like leaves which are arranged into an open cone and are blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers on umbels which can be up to 16 cm (6 in) in diameter. Dill can grow up to 1.5 m (5 ft) in height and is an annual plant, surviving only one growing season. Dill may also be referred to as garden dill and its origin is no known, although it is believed to be native to the Mediterranean.

## Uses

Dill leaves are used fresh or dry as a culinary herb. The leaves may be used to make tea. The seeds of the plant may be used as a spice.Basic requirements

Dill grows best in full sun in temperatures averaging 16–18°C (601–64°F). Dill can be grown in a range of soils but the plants will grow optimally in well-draining sandy loam which is rich in organic matter and has a pH between 5.6 and 6.5. Dill should be planted in an area that receives 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight every day and that is sheltered from strong winds which can easily damage the hollow stalks of the  plant.

### Planting

Dill does not transplant well and it is therefore recommended to direct seed. Seeds should be planted in early Spring after all danger of frost has passed. Sow seeds 1.9 to 2.5 cm (0.75 to 1.0 in) deep, allowing 30 to 38 cm (12-15 in) between plants and 45 cm (18 in) between rows. It is common for dill to be grown between other plants such as onions. Stagger plantings by 2 to 3 weeks for a continuous harvest. Seeds usually germinate within 7 to 21 days depending on the soil temperature.

General care and maintenance

Dill is a hardy plant and can tolerate temperatures down to -3.8°C (25°F) once established, Dill plants require little water, usually irrigating once or twice a week is sufficient and one light application of fertilizer late in the Spring should be enough to sustain the plant for the entire growing season. If the plant is not sufficiently sheltered from wind, the plants will benefit from staking to prevent the hollow stems from snapping.

### Harvesting

Dill is ready to harvest approximately 90 days after planting. Foliage can be harvested anytime but is most flavorsome just before flowering. To harvest the leaves simply cut the leaves at the stem or cut the stem a few inches from the soil line. Seedheads should be harvested 2-3 weeks after bloom before the seeds begin to change color. The seedheads can be hung up to finish drying.

# Eggplant

## Description

Eggplant, Solanum melongena , is a tropical, herbaceous, perennial plant, closely related to tomato, in the family Solanaceae which is grown for its edible fruit. The plants has a branching stem and simple, long, flat. coarsely lobed leaves which are green in color and are arranged alternately on the branches. The leaves can measure 10 to 20 cm (4–8 in) long and 5 to 10 cm (2–4 in) broad. The plant produces purple flowers which are 3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in) in diameter. The fruit is a large, fleshy ovoid berry which can reach 40 cm (15.7 in) in length, with glossy smooth skin and numerous small seeds. The color of the fruit is variable and can be white, green, yellow, purple or black. Eggplants can reach up to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in height and although they are perennial plants, they are most commonly grown as annuals. Eggplant may also be referred to as aubergine or guinea squash and originates from the Indian subcontinent.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Solanum melongena

Common Name: Biringanya (Kenya), Brinjal (South Asia).

## Uses

## Propagation

### Basic requirements

Eggplants are warm-season crops which require a long growing season.They grow best in regions where the daytime temperature is between 26 and 32°C (80–90°F) and night time temperatures around 21°C (70°F). In addition, eggplant is a sun loving plant and should be positioned in an area that receives full sunlight. Plants will perform best when planted in a fertile soil with a pH between 6.3 and 6.8.

### Growing from Seed

In cold areas and regions with a short growing season it is necessary to start eggplant indoors or in a glasshouse. In addition, eggplant will often perform much better in colder areas if planted in containers or grown under row covers as this helps to keep the soil warm. Seeds should be sown indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost date. Sow seeds thickly in seed trays containing good quality sterile seed starting mix to a depth of 6 mm (0.25 in). Keep the trays moist and provide bottom heat by placing on a heat mat or in a warm area of the house. Seedling should be potted into larger pots when they have two sets of true leaves. Transplanting Eggplant seedlings can be transplanted after hardening-off and when all danger of frost has passed in your area. Seedlings should be spaced 45–60 cm (18–24 in) apart, depending on variety, allowing a further 60–90 cm (24–36 in) between rows.

General care and maintenance

Eggplant may benefit from the addition of mulch to conserve soil moisture and maintain a higher soil temperature. Row covers will help to increase the temperature around the plants in cooler climates and during cool spells in otherwise warm areas. The row covers should be removed to allow pollinators to access the plants during flowering. Eggplant should be provided with a steady water supply for optimum development of fruit and the soil around the plants should not be allowed to dry out but should also not be wet. Plants can be laden with numerous fruit and the use of stakes and supports can help to support the plants before harvest.

### Harvesting

Eggplant fruits are ready to harvest while the flesh is still firm and seeds are small and tightly packed. The skin of the fruit should be firm, glossy and dark purple. Over ripe fruit will contain darker seeds and will taste bitter. Harvest the fruit as soon as it is ripe to ensure maximum productivity. The fruit should be removed from the plant by cutting the calyx (green stem above the fruit) with a sharp knife.

## Common Pests and Diseases

# Endive

## Description

Endive, Cichorium endivia, is an annual or biennial herbaceous plant in the family Asteraceae grown as a salad green.  The plant is a short stemmed herb with a rosette of leaves which are arranged alternately on the stem. The leaves become smaller toward the top of the stem The leaves can be broad and flat, curly or frizzy depending in the variety and are generally 10–25 cm (3.9–9.8 in) in length. The endive plant produces an inflorescence consisting of 1–3 blue flowers. Endive plants can grow to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in height and are typically grown as an annual with only one growing season.  Endive may also be referred to as Ceylon spinach, escarole or chicory and originates from the Mediterranean.

## Uses

Endive leaves are eaten fresh as a salad green.Basicl requirements

Endive is a cool season plant and grows best in short days and cool temperatures. The optimum temperature for the plants growth is between 15 and 18°C (59–64.4°F). The plants will grow best in a loose, fertile soil or well draining loam with a pH of 6.5–7.8 and should be positioned in full sun or partial shade. Endive will tolerate light frost and harvesting after frost will improve the flavor of the leaves.

Growing from seed

Endive can be direct seeded or started indoors to produce transplants. Seeds germinate at temperatures between 1.7 and 29.4°C (35–85°F), with 23.8°C (75°F) being optimal. Seeds should be sown to a depth of 0.6 cm (0.25 in) in high quality potting soil or, if direct seeding, a finely prepared bed. Seeds can be sown outdoors 2 to 4 weeks before the last frost date. Sow seeds 5–10 cm  (2–4 in) apart, leaving approximately 45 cm (18 in) between rows.

General care and maintenance

Endive is prone to bolting in warm weather. If the temperature rises above 24°C (75°F) then care should be taken to keep the plants well watered and shaded from strong sunlight. About a week before harvest, the outer leaves of heading varieties should be tied up around the head to blanch the plant to prevent it developing a bitter flavor. The plants can also be blanches by covering the entire plant with a pot or box to exclude light.

### Harvest

The entire head should be cut at ground level after blanching using a sharp knife. Harvest the plants early if very hot weather or a hard frost is expected.

# Fenugreek

## Description

Fenugreek, Trigonella foenum-graecum, is an herbaceous annual plant in the family Fabaceae grown for its leaves and seeds which are used as a herb or spice. The fenugreek plant may have a single stem or may be branched at the stem base. The plant has an erect growth habit and a strong, sweet aroma. The leaves of the plant are small and trifoliate with oval leaflets which are green to purple in color. The plant produces solitary pale white or purplish flowers and a straight or occasionally curved yellow pod which houses the seeds. Between 10 and 20 seeds are produced per pod and they are small, smooth and brown, each divided into two lobes. Fenugreek can reach a height of 60 cm (23.6 in) and as an annual, survives only one growing season. The origin of fenugreek is unknown but it is indigenous to the western Mediterranean.

## Uses

Fenugreek leaves can be used fresh or dried as a culinary herb. The seeds are used as a spice or flavoring.Basic requirements

Fenugreek is a sun-loving plant which is usually grown as a cool season crop. It grows optimally in well draining loams or sandy loams with a pH between 5.8 and 8.2. it will not grow well in heavy clay. Fenugreek is moderately drought resistant and can be grown in areas with low amounts of rainfall. In areas where the summer temperatures are high it is grown as a cool season crop but can be grown over summer in more temperate climates. The plants can withstand light frost.

## Propagation

Fenugreek is propagated from seed and it does not withstand transplanting. It should be direct seeded to a depth of 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) allowing 7.5 cm (3 in) between individual plants and 20–45 cm (8–18 in) between rows. It may also be be spread by broadcasting.

General care and maintenance

The most important aspect of fenugreek cultivation is keeping the bed free from weeds. Beds should be weeded regularly to prevent competition with the developing plants. The plants will benefit from additional irrigation if rainfall is not adequate. In addition, productivity of fenugreek grown for seed will be increased with the addition of potash and phosphate fertilizer.

### Harvesting

Fenugreek grown for seed is ready to harvest within 3 to 5 months after planting. The plants are harvested by uprooting and are then hung up to dry to allow seeds to be collected. In India, where the plant is grown as a vegetable crop, young shoots and leaves are harvested earlier and the plant is allowed to regrow before harvesting again.

# Fig

## Description

The Common Fig, Ficus carica, is a deciduous tree or shrub in the family Moraceae grown for its edible fruits. The fig tree has numerous spreading branches and palmate leaves. The leaves are deeply lobed and thick with a rough upper surface and hairy lower surface. They have irregular teeth on the margins. The fig fruit is not technically a fruit, but a syconium, a flesh, hollow receptacle with tiny flowers on the inside walls. The fig is roughly oval or pear-shaped and can be yellow-green, bronze or dark purple in color. Fig trees can range in height from 3 to 9 m (10–30 ft) and can live for 50–75 years depending on conditions. Fig trees are believed to originate from Western Asia.

## Uses

Fig fruits are consumed fresh or dried or may be processed to produce jams or fig paste.Basic requirements

Fig trees grow in both mild temperate climates and in the tropics, where it grows as an evergreen. The tree is not generally very cold hardy and new growth in Spring can be damaged by temperatures of -1°C (30.2°F). Fig trees can be successfully grown on many types of soil but will grow optimally in deep sandy-clay loams with a pH between 6 and 8. Very light soils are not conducive to fig production and should be amended prior to planting through the addition of organic matter. Fig trees should be planted in full sun. In the home landscape, planting the to the South or East of a building can help protect them during cold spells in winter.

## Propagation

Fig trees are generally vegetatively propagated from cuttings which are rooted in a nursery. Cuttings should be taken from the previous years growth in winter when the tree is dormant and should be 25 to 30 cm (10-12 in) in length. The cuttings should be severed at the nodes and planted in prepared nursery beds or pots to the tips to allow a strong root system to develop before transplanting. The rooted cuttings should be ready for transplant the following winter.

### Transplanting

Fig trees are traditionally planted as dormant rooted cuttings in winter or early spring. A hole should be dug that is deeper and wider than the existing root system as the cuttings perform well if planted a few inches deeper than in the nursery. Position the tree at the correct depth and carefully crumble the soil around the roots, tamping gently several times as the hole is filled. The newly planted tree should be watered to help settle the soil around the roots. It is not necessary to fertilize fig at time of planting. Once planted, the tree should be cut back by about 1/3 to counteract the effect of root loss during transplanting. If planting more than one tree, they should be positioned at least 6 m (20 ft) apart.

General care and maintenance

Figs are typically grown as rain-fed trees in Mediterranean climates but the trees grow best when they have access to constant moisture as water stress can cause early leaf drop. Soil moisture can be conserved by mulching around the trees. Organic mulches also have the benefit of providing the tree with nutrients. Fig trees do benefit from the addition of fertilizer and the type and amount varies with the variety being grown.

### Pruning

In sub-tropical areas, figs are commonly grown as a single trunk tree, however, in more temperate climates, it is common for fig to exist as a multi-trunked vase-shaped trees. This is encouraged through pruning to three or four primary branches from the trunk and two to three secondary branches stemming from the primary branches. For the first few years, fig trees are pruned severely but after the shape has been formed pruning is limited to the removal of branches which are growing upright, touching the ground or those interfering with the growth of other branches.

# Finger Millet

## Description

Finger millet, Eleusine coracana, is an annual grass in the family Poaceae which is grown for its grain which can be used for food or for brewing. Finger millet is a robust tillering grass which grows in tufts. It has erect, light green stems. The leaves of the plant are dark green, linear and mainly smooth with some hair along the leaf edges. The inflorescence of the plant is a cluster of 3–26 ‘fingers’ composed of dense spikelets where the grain, or seed, is produced. Finger millet can reach 1.7 m (5.6 ft) in height and  is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season. Finger millet may also be referred to as African fingermillet, goosegrass or millet and originates from the highlands of Eastern Africa.

## Uses

Finger millet grains are commonly cooked and made into a porridge to accompany other foods.Grain may also be used in the brewing of alcoholic beverages. Millet straw can be used as an animal feed.Basic requirements

Finger millet requires warm temperatures to develop optimally and as such is mainly grown in the tropics. The optimum temperature for the growth of the plants is between 18°C (64.4°C F) and 27°C (80.6°F) and the plants require an average of 750 mm of rainfall over the course of the growing season. Finger millet can be grown in a wide range of soils but a fertile, well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.5 and 5.8 is optimal. Finger millet will not tolerate drought and will not grow well in areas with heavy rainfall.

### Planting

If being grown as a rain-fed crop, finger millet is directly seeded in the field by broadcasting. Seeds should be sown to a depth of 2.5 cm (1.0 in) allowing 25 cm (10 in) between rows and 10–12 cm (4–5 in) between plants. The soil is commonly ridged to promote drainage in wet soils. When adequate irrigation is not available, the seeds are grown in nurseries to create transplant which are transferred to the field later. Finger millet is commonly intercropped with sorghum, maize or legumes such as pigeon pea or cowpea.

General care and maintenance

The seedbed should be kept free from weeds as the plants develop to prevent competition for light and nutrients. The plants should be provided with additional irrigation during dry periods. Finger millet benefits from the addition of chemical fertilizers. In Africa, farmers fertilize using ash, while in India it is common for farmers to spread cow or sheep manure on the crop.

### Harvesting

Finger millet is usually ready to harvest between 3.5 and 5 months after sowing depending on the variety. The crop is usually harvested by hand by cutting the seed heads or by cutting the entire plant.

# Fonio

## Description

White fonio, Digitaria exilis, is an annual grass in the family Poaceae grown for its grain which is commonly used to make porridge. Fonio is an erect, tillering grass with delicate stems and alternate leaves. The leaves are blade like or linear and tapering and can reach up to 15 cm (6 in) in length. The plant produces spikelets, where the grain is produced, on branched, spike-like panicles. A single inflorescence possesses 2–5 racemes with spikelets arranged in pairs or in threes or fours, giving it a lacy appearance. White fonio can reach a height of 30–80 cm (11.8–31.5 in) depending on variety and is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season. White fonio may also be referred to fonio, hungry rice or hungry millet and originates from West Africa.

## Uses

The fonio grain is consumed after cooking, either as a porridge or couscous. The grain may also be ground and mixed with other cereals. Fonio grain may be used to brew beers and the straw can be used as animal fodder.Basic requirements

Fonio is a tropical plant and requires a dry season to grow properly. The plant grows optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30°C (77–86°F) and in areas where the average rainfall is between 900 and 1000 mm. Fonio can be grown on a range of soils and it is generally grown in soils that are considered too nutrient poor for other crops. The plants will grow best in light, sandy soils and it is often planted in rotation with rice, sorghum or millet.

### Planting

Fonio is direct seeded by broadcasting in the field and germinates and grows rapidly, out-competing weeds and negating the need for weeding the field. The soil is roughly loosened prior to planting and seed is generally broadcast at a rate of 10 to 30 kg of seed/ha. The seeds are then lightly dug into the soil or covered using a hoe and allowed to germinate.

General care and maintenance

Fonio requires little maintenance after planting and is highly adapted to drought conditions.

### Harvesting

Fonio is harvested using traditional methods, The plants are cut using a knife or sickle and gathered into sheaths for drying. Processing the grain is a laborious process that requires beating the dried plants to extract the grain and then dehulling the grain using a mortar.

# Garlic (Allium Sativum)

## Description

Garlic is one of the most used crops among the cultivated Allium species. It is a perennial flowering plant that grows from a bulb that contains outer layers of thin, whitish sheaths or skin that enclose various lobes known as cloves. One garlic bulb may contain 10 to 20 edible cloves that are asymmetrical in shape, except for the small ones, which are close to the center. Cloves, which are also covered by protective whitish skin, have a distinctive smell.

Garlic, either in fresh or powdered form, is mainly used as a seasoning or condiment for flavoring food. It also has nutritional value, as raw garlic contains protein, starch, small amounts of fat and sugar, and high levels of potassium and vitamin C. Furthermore, garlic is widely valued for its medicinal importance as it contains bioactive constituents that are believed to help the body fight viral, fungal, and bacterial infections, among other health benefits such as lowering blood sugar and cholesterol levels, among others.

In addition, garlic extracts have pesticide properties that play a vital role in protecting plants from some pests and diseases like African armyworm, downy mildew, and rice bugs, among others. While it is beneficial in organic farming, its use as a pesticide should be moderated as it can kill beneficial soil bacteria and insects due to its broad-spectrum effects.

Garlic is believed to have originated in Central Asia (China). It then spread to the Mediterranean region in ancient times and was already known in Egypt by 3000 BC. Today, garlic is cultivated across the globe at latitudes ranging from 5 to 50 in both the northern and southern hemispheres.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Allium Sativum

Common Name: Kitungu saumu (Swahili

## Uses & Benefits

Garlic is primarily used for flavoring food and can be dried, ground or powdered for this purpose.

## Varieties

It is difficult to identify the wild primogenitor of common garlic due to the presence of numerous cultivars (clones). This makes it difficult to classify the clones. Despite this, there are two well-known garlic varieties, namely, cv. group Ophioscorodon, also known as hard-necked garlic, and cv. group Common Garlic, commonly referred to as soft-necked garlic (CABI, 2019).

While the cv. group Common Garlic has a straight stalk, the cv. group Ophioscorodon, on the other hand, has a curvy scape. In addition, hard-necked garlic is best suited for the northern climate, while soft-necked garlic flourishes in southern climates. The two varieties do well in Kenya, although the soft-necked is more commonly planted.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Temperature, and length of day are important factors in bulbing and bolting. Garlic is grown in a temperature-limited range of 9–28 °C. It is required that the propagules be exposed to 10–15 °C for 2 months to allow proper bulbing. Moreover, lower temperatures ranging from -2 to 6 °C are necessary for vernalization. Day length (>12 hours), on the other hand, stimulates clove formation. Garlic growth is easily adapted to all latitudes due to its wide genetic variation in response to temperature and day length. For instance, it is grown in the highlands around the equator to increase its growth. Also, garlic growth is recommended during the prevailing long-day season and at high altitudes in the tropics. In areas that experience long seasons of sub- freezing temperatures, mulching is advised to protect the plants from the cold. Mulching also conserves moisture and control weed growth.

Garlic requires fertile, well-drained, non-crusting mineral soil, in organic matter to increase yields. It should also be planted in raised beds to allow good soil drainage, which is essential.

Garlic plants perform well in areas with low rainfall since excess rain and humidity are bad for their growth. Regular irrigation during dry seasons is advised, where moisture in the top 30 cm of the soil should be maintained during the entire growth period to attain maximum yields. However, in some areas, stopping irrigation three weeks before harvest is recommended to prevent rotting and skin color loss.

### Growing from Seed

Prepare the soil a few weeks before planting for aeration; remove rocks and loosen the soil. While garlic can grow in soil with high organic matter, it can also grow in a variety of soil conditions and pH levels. A basal dressing of 200 kg/ha of triple superphosphate is recommended during soil tillage.

Garlic is usually grown as an annual crop. It is normally cultivated using cloves as seeds. To have quality and maximum yields, a farmer needs to plant healthy cloves. During seed selection, it is recommended that cloves planted should be of about equal weight (depending on cultivar) for uniformity purposes. The quantity of planting material is dependent on the size of the clove and the density of the plants.

During planting, place selected cloves 8–10 cm apart within the rows and 15-20 cm between rows to leave enough space for bulbs to grow and mature well. The cloves should be planted with the pointed side up and the base down. Garlic plants are best grown as sole crops on raised beds alternated with furrows. Protect the garlic cloves through mulching.

### General Care and Maintenance

Planting, watering, weeding, and harvesting are all done by hand.

Avoid under-watering or over-watering the plants to allow optimal bulb formation. In cases where there is no rain, light watering (one inch deep) is enough. Dripline irrigation is recommended during the dry season.

Remove weeds that might hinder the crops from accessing maximum light, water, and nutrients. This can be done by mulching, hand hoeing, or spraying herbicides.

80 kg/ha of ammonium sulphate is mixed with 50 kg/ha of potassium chloride and 80 kg/ha of urea and then applied as side dressings at 15, 30, and 45 days after planting.

### Harvesting

Garlic grows about 60 cm (2 feet) tall. The duration of subsequent growth and development phases strongly depends on the prevailing conditions. The total growing period varies depending on the area, where harvesting takes place 3–4 months after planting (in the tropics) to about 9 months (for winter garlic in temperate regions). Harvesting is done once the leaves start turning yellow and begin to dry up. Once ready, the farmer pulls the bulbs out of the soil using their hands. They are then tied in bunches for drying and later stored in a dry place with good ventilation to inhibit growth or decay.

# Ginger

## Description

Ginger, Zingiber officinale, is an erect, herbaceous perennial plant in the family Zingiberaceae grown for its edible rhizome (underground stem) which is widely used as a spice. The rhizome is brown, with a corky outer layer and pale-yellow scented center. The above ground shoot is erect and reed-like with linear leaves that are arranged alternately on the stem. The shoots originate from a multiple bases and wrap around one another. The leaves can reach 7 cm (2.75 in) in length and 1.9 cm (0.7 in) broad. Flowering heads are borne on shorter stems and the plant produces cone shaped, pale yellow flowers . The ginger plant can reach 0.6–1.2 m in height (2–4 ft) and is grown as an annual plant.  Ginger may also be referred to as true ginger, stem ginger, garden ginger or root ginger and it is believed to have originated in the Southeast Asia.

## Uses

Ginger is popularly used as a spice in cooking and can be used either fresh, dried or powdered. The fresh rhizome can be used to extract ginger essential oil.  Ginger may also be used to flavor beverages. Ginger continues to be a popular folk remedy in China and India.Basic requirements

As a tropical plant, ginger grows best in warm and sunny climates in a deep but well draining soil loam that is high in organic matter. The optimum soil pH for growth of ginger is between 6.0 and 6.5 and the plant requires a minimum temperature of 15.5°C (59.9°F). Ginger plants require an average annual rainfall of between 250 and 300 cm for optimal growth and development and require additional irrigation where rainfall is not adequate. Ginger plants will not tolerate waterlogged soils.

## Propagation

Ginger is vegetatively propagated from small sections of the rhizome, called sets.  Sets are produced by cutting a small 3–6 cm from a living rhizome. Each piece should possess at least one living bud which will produce shoots. The ginger sets can be pre-sprouted in pots or nursery seed beds by covering with a layer of soil or they can be planted directly at the final planting location. The bed should be prepared for planting by digging to soil to a fine tilth and removing any weeds that are present. The addition of lime to the soil adjusts the pH while helping to provide the calcium required by the plants during their growth. Lime should be added to the soil in appropriate amounts in the Fall prior to planting. The sets should then be planted in early Spring at a depth of 5–12 cm, leaving 15–35 cm between plants and 25–30 cm between rows. For optimal growth, the soil temperature at planting should not fall below 25°C (77°F).

General care and maintenance

Ginger has a tendency to grow horizontally and the soil can be hilled around the growing stems to force a more vertical growth habit. Soil should be hilled 3 to 5 times during the growing season. Any exposed rhizomes should be covered with soil and weeds should be removed from the bed. Ginger will benefit from the addition of a complete fertilizer as well as phosphorous, calcium and organic matter prior to planting. During the growing season, additional fertilizer can be applied as a side dressing. The side dressing should be made 25 to 30 cm (10-12 in) from the row of plants due to ginger being easily damaged by fertilizer applications. Side dressings should be made every 2 to 3 weeks during the growing season to ensure the ginger is suppied with adequate nutrients.

### Harvesting

Ginger is usually harvested after the leaves senesce, dry out and the stem falls over. Ginger roots are harvested by digging. Commercially produced ginger is harvested with the use of cutter bar which is pulled by a tractor. After harvest, the ginger should be cured for 3 to 5 days to prevent the development of mildew on the rhizomes.

# Gooseberry

## Description

Gooseberry (Ribes spp.) is a small spiny bush  in the family Rosaceae which is grown for its edible fruit of the same name. The gooseberry bush is a spiny shrub with deeply lobed, dark green leaves and produce bell shaped flowers and green/yellow to red berries approximately 1 inch long containg many tiny seeds.  If managed properly, gooseberry bushes can be very long lived, growing to 0.9–3.0 m (3–10 ft) tall and up to 1.8 m (6 ft) wide and producing a crop of fruit each spring. The gooseberry has been derived mainly from two species, the European gooseberry Ribes grossularia, native to North Africa, and the American gooseberry (Ribes hirtellum), native to Northeast and central US and parts of Canada.  The American gooseberry tends to be smaller than the species grown in Europe, with weeping stems that will rot easily if they are allowed to be in contact with the ground.

## Uses

Gooseberries can be eaten fresh or used as an ingredient in other foods such as desserts, jams and preserves or drinks such as tea.  The fruit can also be used as an ingredient for pickling. They are also used to flavor beverages such as sodas, flavored waters, or milk, and can be made into fruit wines and teas. They can be preserved in the forms of jams or dried fruit.Basic requirements

Gooseberries grow best in cool, moist locations and can be damaged by intense summer heat. Gooseberry can be grown in partial shade but it is essential that the plants have a good air circulation around them to help prevent the development of disease. Gooseberry has a chilling requirement of between 1000 to 1200 hours between 1.7 and 7.2°C (35–45°F) to break dormancy. Plants can tolerate cold and light frosts but temperatures below -2°C (28°F) can cause damage to the flower buds. Gooseberries can be grown successfully in a range of soils but perform optimally in well-draining sandy loams which are rich in organic matter with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5.

## Propagation

Gooseberry plants can be planted as rooted plants obtained from a nursery or from cuttings from established plants. Cuttings should be taken in winter or early spring when the plant is dormant. Cuttings should be 15–20 cm (6–8 in) in length and taken from the previous years growth. The cuttings should be stored in sand or peat moss in a refrigerator or other cold location until early spring.

### Planting

Gooseberry plants and cuttings should be planted out in early spring. Plants obtained from a nursery should have a strong root system. Remove any damaged roots prior to planting and cut the stems back so that they are between 15 and 25 cm (6–10 in) depending on the size of the root system. Plant the gooseberries in prepared soil a little deeper than they were in the nursery and gently tamp the soil around the plants. Spacing depends on the variety being grown but generally gooseberries should be spaced 0.9–1.5 m (3–5 ft) apart, allowing 2.4–3.0 m (8–10 ft) between rows. Closer spacings can be used if a hedgerow is desired. Cuttings should be similarly spaced. The tips of the cuttings can be dipped in rooting hormone prior to planting to encourage root development.

### Pruning

Gooseberries should be pruned in the winter while dormant. Damaged or drooping canes should be removed as well as any which shade the center of the plant.  After the first year of growth, the plant should be cut to leave 6 to 8 vigorous canes. After the second growing season all but 4 or 5 one year old shoots and 3 or 4 two year old canes should be removed. after the third growing season, retain 3–4 each of 1-, 2- and 3- year old wood. After the fourth growing season, all of the four year old wood should be removed and the plants should be pruned annually following the directions for after the third growing season.

# Gourd

## Description

Gourds are annual trailing or climbing vines in the family Cucurbitaceae grown for their fruit of the same name. The two most commonly grown types of gourd are Lagenaria species and Cucurbita species. Gourd plants produce long vines with long-stemmed, large, oval or triangular lobed leaves. The Cucurbita gourds produce yellow flowers and unusually shaped fruit which can be smooth or warty, plain or patterned. The Lagenaria gourds produce white flowers and smooth, knobly or ridged fruit which can range in size from 7 cm (3 in) up to 1 m (3 ft). Gourd vines are capable of climbing over 3.5 m (12 ft) and  as annual plants, survive only one growing season. Gourds may also be referred to as dudi, cucuzzi, spaghetti squash or calabash and are believed to have originated in Africa.

## Uses

Young gourds can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable while the mature gourds are used to make decorative items such as bottles, containers and utensils. In the US, gourds have become a very popular household decoration in the Fall.Basic requirements

Gourds are warm-season crops, requiring lots of sun and good drainage to develop optimally. Plants will grow best at temperatures between 18 and 25°C (65–75°F) in a fertile, well-draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5. Gourd plants should be planted in full sun and provided with ample soil moisture. Vining varieties can grow to very large sizes and require a good deal of space.

### Sowing seeds

Gourds can be direct seeded or sown indoors and transplanted. If direct seeding,seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 15.6°C (60°F). Sow 1–2 seeds 1.3–2.5 cm (0.5–1.0 in) deep, at least 90 cm (~3 ft) apart if growing bush varieties and 120–150 cm (4–5 ft) apart if growing vining varieties. Allow a further 1–3 m (6–10 ft) between rows depending on the variety.  If transplanting, seeds should be sown 3–4 weeks before the last frost date in your area and transplanted before the plants develop their second set of true leaves. Sowing seeds in 3–4 inch pots help to minimize disturbance to the roots prior to transplanting. Peat pots can be transplanted with the seedlings eliminating the need to disturb the roots entirely. Seeds in sown both indoors and out require lightly moist soil for germination, care should be taken to avoid overwatering. Seeds should germinate in 5–10 days depending on the soil temperature.

General care and maintenance

Gourd plants sprawling and require plenty space to grow. Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence. Plants also require a continuous supply of water and where drip irrigation is not being used, plants should be watered deeply once per week, providing at least an inch of water. Shallow watering or watering less frequently encourages a shallow root system. Mulches can be used to conserve soil moisture and black polyethylene mulch has the advantage of warming the soil. Gourds produce both male and female flowers (monoecious) and are pollinated by insects such as bees. Poor fruit set is often caused by poor pollination.

# Grape

## Description

The Common or European grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is a long stemmed, woody vine (liana) which produces high value berries, or grapes.  The vines can reach lengths in excess of 30 m and can live for many years with proper management. The leaves of the grape vine are alternately arranged on the stem and are long and broad with 5–7 lobes, typically reaching sizes of 5–20 cm (2.0–7.9 in). Flowers are produced in clusters and fruit. The fruit is a berry known as a grape and grows in clusters from the vine. In wild species, the fruit is 6 mm (1/5 in) in diameter and ripens to dark purple to black with a pale wax bloom. In cultivated plants, the berry is usually much larger, up to 3 cm (1.2 in) long and can be green, red or purple. Vitis vinifera is native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia but is cultivated on every continent except Antarctica.  Most grape cultivation centers on the use of Vitis vinifera, however, in North America the related species Vitis labrusca, Vitis riparia and Vitis rotundifolia are also grown. Vitis amurensis is native to Asia and has been hybridized with Vitis vinifera to produce cold tolerant grapevine varieties.

## Uses

Grapes are the most widely produced commercial fruit crop in the world.  They are often eaten fresh but are also commonly used to produce wine.  Grapes can also be processed into jams,  and preserves, juices, grape seed oil, grape seed extract, raisins and vinegar.Requirements

The first consideration when attempting to cultivate grape is to select a variety based on the prevailing local climate, with the best production occurring in hot, dry regions. American varieties tend to be the most cold hardy while the European hybrids perform best in hotter, drier regions. Generally, vines should be grown in full sun, in a well draining soil and in a location where there is good circulating air to reduce incidence of disease. Low lying areas should be avoided when selecting a planting site as this can lead to water accumulation during periods of wet weathe Vines prefer a soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH between 6.0 and 7.0 and require a trellis system to support the weight of the fruit on the vines.

### Preparation

Grape vines are usually planted as dormant bare root vines in Spring. Young plants can be purchased from nurseries and garden centres for planting in the home garden. Grape vines require a trellis and this should be built before the vines are planted in the ground. For information on constructing a suitable trellis see: https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/192-grape-how-to-build-a-trellis-for-grape-vines?locale=en.

The trellis helps support the weight of the fruit and protects the vines from damage while aslo increasing air circulation and reducing diseases in the canopy. You may also consider a more decorative method of supporting the vines, such as an arbor.

### Planting

New vines should be planted out in Spring after all danger of frost has passed. Dig a hole for each plant approximately 30 cm (12 in) deep and 30 cm (12 in) wide, spaced 1.8– 3.0 m (6–10 ft) apart and plant the vine at the same level as the nursery. It is important not to cover the graft union in soil. Tamp the soil around the plants and add any remaining soil. The newly planted vines should be cut back to have only 2 or 3 new buds and watered lightly.

### Training

In order for grape vines to develop strong root systems and support heavy loads of fruit, new vines should not be allowed to produce fruit for the first 2–3 years after planting. The vine will produce new shoots, of which several should be allowed to grow while the others are cut back. This allows the vine to fill out with leaves which provide energy for an extensive root system. The new shoots should be attached to the trellis. At the beginning of the second year of growth,  select 2–3 of the strongest canes on each plant and cut back the rest. Allow 3 or 4 shoots to develop on each cane and attach to the trellis. Remove any flower clusters that form.

### Pruning

Pruning is an essential component of healthy grape production and should be carried out annually in early Spring while the vines are still dormant and before the buds begin to swell. From the third year onwards, most of the previous years growth should be removed. The more buds that are left on each shoot, the more fruit it will produce but care must be taken to ensure that too many are not left as the fruit may not ripen as a result. Fruit clusters can be removed as required throughout the growing season.

# Grapefruit

## Description

## Uses

Grapefruit can be eaten fresh and is commonly eaten as a breakfast fruit. It can also be used to make juice or processed for canning of segments or pulp. Grapefruit essential oils are used in perfumery.Requirements

Grapefruit is a tropical to subtropical plant and the trees grow best in areas with hot daytime temperatures and warm to hot night time temperatures. Grapefruit is less hardy than orange but continual exposure to cooler temperatures will induce a certain degree of cold tolerance. Mature trees can tolerate short exposures to temperatures below freezing but ice will begin to form in fruit after 2-3 hours at -3°C (27°F). Young trees may be killed by these temperatures. young trees will be killed. Fruit will also be damaged by freezing conditions. The trees will tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water-logged soil. Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development. Grapefruit trees will grow best when planted in full sun.

### Grapefruit propagation

Grapefruit seedlings are usually produced by grafting or budding to an appropriate rootstock as seeds will not produce fruit true to type. Grafting is the process by which a scion from plant is joined to the rootstock of another to produce a new tree. Budding is a special type of grafting where the scion that is joined to the rootstock consists of a single bud. Budding is commonly used in citrus propagation as it is the easier of the two processes and works very well. Common rootstocks for grafting and budding of citrus trees include sour orange and rough lemon.

### Budding

Budding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6–9 mm/0.25–0.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant). Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden. The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which it will be joined. It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees. The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases which can kill trees. The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks which are 20–25 cm (8–10 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves. These budsticks can be stored for 2–3 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting.

The simplest way to join the budwood the the rootstock is by T-budding. The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut made approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground. Using a sharp knife, a 2.5–3.8 cm (1–1.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark. A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a “T-shape” The horizontal cut should be made a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark. Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud. This piece should measure 1.9–2.5 cm(0.75–1.0 in) in length. Immedietely insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant. Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape.

After the union has formed and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem 2.5–3.9 cm (1.0–1.5 in) above the join about 2/3 of the way through the stem on the same side as the join. The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground. This process, known as “lopping” allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in lengthe, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.

### Planting seedlings

Grapefruit trees can be purchased as seedlings which have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard. The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area. Trees should be planted at or higher than the level of the nursery pot. Once the tree is positioned in the planting hole, backfill the soil by about half and water to allow the soil to settle around the lower roots before filling in the hole. The newly planted tree should be watered every few days.

### General care

Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established. During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil. Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3–7 days. The soil should be moist, but not wet. Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently. Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month  in the first year. Grapefruit trees will need protected from cold temperatures to prevent damage. Soil can be mounded up around the trunk during the winter and removed in the Spring. Young trees can also be protected from frosts by covering them with tarps or blankets as required.

#### Huanglongbing (Citrus greening, Yellow dragon disease) Candidatus Liberibacter asiativus Candidatus Liberibacter africanus Candidatus Liberibacter americanus

- Symptoms: Yellowing of one limb or one area of canopy; yellowing of leaf veins; blotchy mottling on leaf blades; twig and limb dieback; fruits dropping prematurely; small upwardly pointing leaves; small, misshapen fruit; fruit very bitter

- Cause: Bacteria

- Comments: History Origins and spread Huanglongbing, or citrus greening, was first reported from Southern China in 1919 by American botanist Otto August Reinking who described a “yellow shoot” disease of citrus while evaluating diseases of economic plants in Southern China. A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of “huang long bing”, which translates to “yellow dragon disease”, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees. By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively. The disease has been known by various names in different countries - “greening” in South Africa, “mottle leaf” in the Philippines, “dieback” in India and “vein phloem degeneration” in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia. Biology and ecology The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant. The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter. It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L. africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L. asiaticus , found in .A third species, L. americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements. As this species is found in the same areas as L. asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements. Transmission Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar. Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius, Citrus psyllids Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew. Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed. They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers. When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days. In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur. It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments. Grafting Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956. The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.

- Management: Management Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured. Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus. Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified. In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms. (ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays. Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T. eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk. In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids.

# Guava

## Description

Guava, Psidium guajava, is an evergreen shrub or small tree in the family Myrtaceae grown for its edible fruits. Guava has a slender trunk with smooth green to red-brown bark. The trunk may be branched at the base and the branches droop low to the ground. The plant possesses oval or elliptical leaves which are smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the lower surface. Guava produces solitary white flowers and a berry fruit. The fruit is oval in shape and green to yellow in color. The flesh inside can be white, yellow, pink or red in color and contains numerous yellowish seeds. Guava can reach grow to 10 m (33 ft) in height and lives for approximately 40 years. Guava may also be referred to as common guava and its origin is unknown although it grows native in parts of tropical America.

## Uses

Guava fruits may be eaten fresh or processed to produce paste, jellies or preserves. Dehydrated fruit is used to make guava powder.Basic requirements

Guava is mainly grown in the tropics and will tolerate temperatures between 15 and 45°C (59–113°F). Guava will grow optimally between 23 and 28°C (73–82°F) but established trees can tolerate short periods at -3 to -2°C (27-28°F) although temperatures below 15°C (60°F) can cause the tree to cease producing fruit. Guava is also amenable to a wide range of soils and will grow in both sandy or rocky soils in addition to loams, preferring a pH of 4.5–7 but tolerating alkaline soil to to pH 8.5.  Guava is more resistant to drought than most tropical fruits and can withstand long periods of dry weather by ceasing vegetative growth until conditions improve.

## Propagation

Guavas grown for processing can be grown from seed as approximately 70% of the seedlings will retain the genetic characteristics of the parent tree. Guavas that are grown for fresh fruit are usually vegetatively propagated by air layering or budding.

### Planting seeds

Guava seeds are usually started in nursery beds or pots before being transplanted in the field or garden. Only seeds from healthy, vigorous trees with the desired characteristics should be planted. Seeds should be planted in flats containing sandy soil and covered to a depth of 6 mm (0.25 in). Seeds usually germinate within 15 to 20 days of planting. When the seedlings reach 3.8 cm (1.5 in) in height they should be transplanted into individual pots. Seedling are ready to be moved to the field after about 6 to 7 months when they have reached approximately 30.5 cm (12 in) in height.

### Transplanting seedlings

Guava trees should be planted in full sun and should be spaced 4.5–7.5 m (15–25 ft) away from other trees and buildings to prevent shading. A hole should be dug which is slightly larger than the existing root ball and the addition of a layer of compost or rotted manure at the bottom of the planting hole. The tree should be planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery by placing the seedling upright into the planting hole and backfilling the soil around the plant. The soil should be tamped by hand around the tree to eliminate any air pockets. Water the newly planted seedlings immediately unless the soil is already damp.

General care and maintenance

Newly planted guava trees should be watered every two days after planting for the first week and then once a week for the following few months to allow the root system to develop and become established. A 0.6 to 1.5 m (2.0-5.0 ft) area around the trunk should be maintained to be free from grass and weeds. Guava trees benefit from the application of a layer or organic mulch such as bark or wood chips around the base. This helps to suppress weeds and conserve moisture in the soil. Do not mound the mulch around the trunk, allow a gap of 20 to 30 cm (8-10 in) between the trunk and the mulch layer.  Young trees benefit from fertilizer application with the type an amount varying with area and soil type.

### Pruning

Young trees should be pruned to encourage the development of laterals. This is achieved by cutting back existing laterals at 30 to 60 cm (1 to 2 ft). During the first year of growth, 3 to 4 of the lateral branches should be allowed to grow 60 to 90 cm (24-36 in) before the tips are cut to encourage further branching. any new shoots formed by this process should also be tipped when they reach 60 to 90 cm (24-36 in). Pruning of established trees should be carried out to retain a manageable height and to open out the canopy.

### Harvesting

Trees grown from seed may not come into production for anywhere between 3 to 8 years. Guava does not ripen off the tree and it can be difficult to distinguish when the fruits are ready for harvest. The best indication is a color change from dark to light green and the development of some yellowing on the fruits. Fruit should be harvested every 2-3 days to prevent fruit becoming overripe.

# Hazelnut (filbert)

## Description

Hazelnut, belongs to the family Corylus, which includes C. avellana (Common or European hazelnut) and the closely related species C. maxima (filbert). Hazels are deciduous trees or shrubs in the family Betulaceae grown for their edible nuts. Hazelnuts are large multi-stemmed shrubs or small trees with rounded leaves which possess a doubly serrated margin (each tooth bears another tooth). They produces flowers very late in the winter prior to the emergence of any leaves. The female flowers are small and only the bright red stigmas are visible protruding from the bud. The male flower is a catkin which is pale yellow in color and measures 6–12 cn (2–5 in) in length. The fruit of the hazelnut is a classic nut which grows in clusters of 1–5, each protected by a leafy husk which covers most (common) or all of the nut (filbert). The nut is oval in shape and yellow to brown in colour. Each has a pale scale at its base. When ripe, the nut falls from the husk to the ground. Hazenut can reach a height of 3–8 m (10–26 ft) and can live for many years, although its commercial lifespan is usually about 40 years. Hazelnut originates from Europe and South East Asia.

## Uses

The kernel of the hazelnut is edible and can be eaten raw or toasted. The kernels can be processed to produce praline or as an ingredient in confectionery and baked goods.Basic requirements

Filberts are hardy plants which can survive adverse growing conditions. They should be grown in a soil which is at least 2.4 to 3 m (8-10 ft) deep and will grow optimally in well-draining, fertile loams with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5 in full sun or partial shade. Filberts will grow well in areas where wild hazel grows large and vigorous.

### Propagation methods

While it is possible to propagate filberts from cuttings, the success rate for obtaining rooted cuttings is usually only between 20 and 50%. The most successful method of propagating filberts is by layering. The most successful and widely used method of layering for commercial filbert production is tip layering. Tip layering involves bending shoots into a V-shape and burying the lower parts in the soil to a depth of 20 to 25 cm (8-10 in) while the tips of the shoot, which will form the new tree tops, are kept upright. The soil is kept moist to promote root development above the V bend on the tip and roots should ideally be congregated in a 5 to 10 cm (2-4 in) section of the shoot.

### Planting

Trees should be planted in early winter while dormant. The trees should be planted at least 6 m (20 ft) apart. Before planting, remove as much as possible of the old layered shoot and prune back the ends of any broken roots. Plant the tree in a hole large enough to accommodate the roots but avoid deep planting. Fill in the hole around the roots with fine soil, pressing down with your hands to eliminate any air pockets around the roots. Add soil on top of the roots and tamp down to set the tree. Fill in the remainder of the hole with loosely packed soil. Once planted, the tree should be headed back in order to compensate for reduced water uptake. the tree should be cut back to a height of 45 to 76 cm (18-30 in).

### Suckering

Hazelnut trees produce suckers which should be removed from the tree at, or close to, their point of origin on the trunk. This can be achieved by gently removing the soil from around the sucker. While the trunk is exposed, any other buds which are beginning to show should also be removed. Cutting the sucker at or just below the soil line will encourage more suckers so it is important to make the cut as close to the trunk as possible.

### Harvesting

Newly planted trees usually bear nuts within two to three years after planting although full production may not be reached until twenty five years after planting. The nuts are usually harvested two to three times over the season. The nuts can be spread out on the ground to dry or, as with commercially produced nuts, dried artificially at a temperature of 90 to 100°C (176-212°F).

# Hop

## Description

Hop, Humulus lupulus, is a climbing perennial plant in the family Cannabaceae that is grown for its flowers which are used extensively in the brewing industry. The hop plant is a climbing plant with grasping hooks that help it grasp the substrate. The plant climbs upwards in a clockwise direction and has opposing pairs of leaves which are covered in hairs.  The plant produces flowers called 'burrs' which develop into scaly cones, or 'hops'. The hop plant vine can grow 6–9 m (20–30 ft) in length and can be harvested for many years.  Hop may also be referred to as common hop and likely originated from Central Asia but now grows native in many areas in the Northern Hemisphere.

## Uses

Hop cones are usually dried and used in the brewing of beer to impart bitterness and aroma.Basic requirements

Hop plants can grow in a wide variety of soils as long as there is adequate drainage, but a loose loam or sandy loam with a high organic content and a pH between 6.0 and 7.5 will produce optimal growth. Hop plants are perennial and can be harvested for many years, they should be provided with adequate vertical space to allow the vines to spread.  Hop plants should be grown in full sun and require a tall trellis or fence which is large enough to support 6 to 9 m (20-30 ft) of vine growth. The plants require a period of approximately 8 weeks at low temperature in order to break dormancy.

## Propagation

Hop plants are vegetatively propagated from the pieces of rhizome which should be obtained from a reputable breeder. Only female rhizomes should be planted as it is the female flower that is harvested. Plants grown from seed exhibit highly variable characteristics and are not suitable for commercial production.

### Planting

Hops should be planted as soon as the soil can be worked in the Spring. The plants can survive a frost but will not tolerate the ground freezing over. Rhizomes should be kept refrigerated until the soil is ready for planting. Rhizomes should be planted horizontally in trenches approximately 30 cm (12 in) deep, leaving 1.5–2.5 m (5–8.2 ft) between plants. Hop plant require a trellis system in order to train the long vines. The support system usually consists of a supporting pole and wire with strings for the plant to grow on. There may be up to four strings per plant which are fixed from the ground to the wire.

General care and maintenance

After the first year of growth, the plants will produce an excessive amount of shoots which need to be cut back once several shoots have been selected and trained to grow on the supporting structure. Unwanted shoots can also be defoliated using chemicals. Mounding earth around the base of the plants will help to reduce the amount of unwanted shoots. The soil around the hop vines should be amended with compost every spring and the vines will also benefit from a side dressing of nitrogen fertilizer later in the growing season.

### Harvesting

Hop cones should be harvested before the first frost. Generally, cones are harvested in mid-August to mid-September. The cones will have a papery texture when they are ready and will produce a fine yellow powder and strong aroma when crushed. The lower bracts of the cone may also be beginning to turn brown. The vines should be lowered to the ground and the cones removed from the plant. the cones should be dried prior to storage by threading them out thinly on a screen and allowing to air dry. The cones are fully dry when the inner stem becomes brittle.

# Horseradish

## Description

Horseradish, Armoracia rusticana, is an herbaceous perennial plant in the family Brassicaceae that is cultivated for its large, edible root. The leaves of the plant grow in a distinctive rosette pattern sprouting from single or multiple stems.  The leaves have long petioles and can be smooth or crinkled, reaching 30–100 cm (12–40 in) in length.  The taproot is thick and fleshy and cylindrical in shape and can reach 50 cm (20 in) in length.  The plant produces many white flowers on racemes.  Horseradish plants are usually grown as annuals, surviving only one growing season and can reach a height of 1.5 m (5 ft). Horseradish may also be referred to as red cole or pepper rod and originates from south-eastern Europe and western Asia.

## Uses

Horseradish is grown as a vegetable and can be eaten fresh or cooked. Due to its bitter taste, it is commonly used to make sauces which accompany meat or fish.Basic requirements

Horseradish grows best in temperate climates in full sun or partial shade at temperatures between 15.5 and 28°C (60–65°F) . If grown as an annual, the plant requires a long growing season with a warm summer and cooler temperatures in late summer and fall to allow the flavor to develop in the root. Horseradish can be grown in most soils as long as they are well draining but will grow optimally in a deep, fertile, well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.

## Propagation

Horseradish is usually vegetatively propagated by dividing crowns or from root cuttings. It can be grown from supermarket bought root as it is not treated with any chemicals that affect growth. The disadvantage is that the variety and characteristics may not be known. Root pieces are small, pencil size pieces of root which grow from the main root. They are referred to a sets and as the horseradish root exhibits polarity, it is important to make a note of which end of the set is the top and which is the bottom in order to plant the piece the correct orientation. A good way of doing this is to use a straight cut across the top end of the set and an oblique cut at the bottom. If planting by dividing an established crown, the plant should be carefully dug from the soil and split into four equal pieces each with some leaf and root.

### Planting

Horseradish sets should be planted as soon as the soil is workable in the spring. The soil should be prepared for planting by double digging and incorporating composted organic matter and all purpose fertilizer. The root sets can be planted in shallow trenches which are approximately 10 to 12 cm (4-5 in) allowing 45–60 cm (18–24 in) between individual plants and deep and at least 30 cm (1 ft) between rows. The sets should be planted at a 45° angle so that the top of the set is higher in the soil than the bottom end.

General care and maintenance

Horseradish should be provided with approximately 1 to 2 inches of water each week. Additional irrigation may be required during dry spells. Care should be taken not to overwater the plants or allow them to become too dry as this will affect the flavor of the harvested root. An additional dose of fertilizer high in potassium and phosphorous but low in nitrogen should be applied 4 to 8 weeks after planting. Excess nitrogen should be avoided as it will encourage too much top growth on the plants and will also cause the roots to branch. Horseradish plants will benefit from the addition of a layer of organic mulch which will help to suppress weed growth. I f no mulch is added then any weeds around young horseradish should be removed by gently cultivation the soil around the plants. Many growers make use of the practice of lifting and suckering their horseradish plants. Once the plant has begun to grow, it is gently lifted to expose the crown and any branching roots are removed. This focusses the plants energy on growing the main root.

### Harvesting

Horseradish should be harvested when the tops have been frozen back in the fall. In commercial fields, the tops of the plants are mowed back to facilitate mechanical digging. In the home garden, the roots can be dug up with a fork and the tops removed after harvest. The roots should be scrubbed clean before storing. Leaving some small pieces of root in the ground will allow the plant to regrow the following year. If regrowth is not desired then all pieces of root should be dug up and removed to prevent the horseradish becoming a weed in the garden.

# Kale

## Description

Kale, Brassica oleracea variant acephala, is a leafy herbaceous biennial or perennial plant in the family Brassicaeae grown as a leafy green vegetable. The kale plant is a non-heading, cabbage like plant with curly or straight, loose blue-green or purple leaves. Kale is usually grown as as an annual plant, harvested after one growing season and can reach a height of 1 m (3.3 ft). Kale may also be referred to as borecole or non-heading cabbage or broccoli and its exact origins are unknown, although it grows native in regions of the eastern Mediterranean and Asia.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Brassica oleracea

Common Name :sukumawiki

## Uses & Benefits

Kale is a nutritious food rich in antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin K, and beta-carotene. It also contains nutrients that can support eye health, weight management and heart health. Loaded with important micronutrients and antioxidants, kale is one of the most nutritious leafy greens available.

In fact, kale contains a variety of beneficial compounds, some of which have powerful medicinal properties. it’s versatile and boasts a nutty, earthy flavour that works well in a wide range of recipes.

Kale is used as a green vegetable and is usually cooked before consumption. Some varieties of kale are grown as decorative ornamental plants due to their attractive, brightly colored foliage.

## Varieties

Thousand Headed: This is a continuous growing and hardy crop that is tolerant to cold temperatures. It can stay in the field for a long time, therefore, giving a higher yield. It has a thick stem with big leaves that are dark green, smooth and attractive. It matures between 90-100 days. It can also be used as fodder for animals. It is easily digestible and easy to cook.

Southern Georgia: It is a very popular seed variety grown across Africa. It has been developed to give high yields while up to 6 months before flowering thus profitable to farmers. The leaves are well flavored and easy to cook. It is popular in the local market. It is adapted to hot areas. It is hardy and resistant to black rot.

Marrow Stem: The variety has dark green leaves and flavor and little fiber. It is vigorous, medium tall with finely curled leaves which are less prone to bird damage.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Kale is cool season crop that grows best in cool, moist conditions. The plant will grow best at temperatures between 4 and 21°C (40–50°F) allowing it to be grown in both Spring and Fall. Kale is a hardy plant, tolerating frost, and will grow optimally in a rich, moist, well draining soil with a pH of 6.5. Kale requires at least six hours of direct sunlight every day.

### Growing from Seed

Kale can be direct seeded or started indoors for transplants. The optimum soil temperature for germination is between 12 and 24°C (55–75°F). Kale seeds should be planted after any danger of hard frost or in a cold frame for transplanting to their final location. For a Fall harvest, try to time seeding so that the plants will mature in cool weather. This often means sowing in July but may be as late as October in warmer Southern regions. Prepare the soil for planting through the addition of nitrogen in the form of bone meal or composted manure. Plant seeds 12 mm (0.5 in) deep allowing 3.5 cm (1 in) between plants in the row. Thin seedlings to a final within row spacing of 45–60 cm (18–24 in). Keep soil moist during germination to prevent a crust from forming on the soil surface as this will cause uneven germination.

### Transplanting

Seedlings started indoors or in a cold frame are ready to be transplanted when they have 3–4 leaves and the daytime temperature has reached 10°C (50°F). Seedlings should be planted at the final spacing for seeds (45–60 cm/18–24 in between plants and 0.6 to 1.2 m/2–4 ft between rows). Plant each seedling slightly deeper than it was previously. The plantings can be staggered in 2 week intervals to prolong the harvest. General care Kale should be kept evenly watered, application of mulch around plants helps to conserve soil moisture. The plants have shallow roots and in order to avoid damaging them, it is preferable to hand pull any weeds growing around the plants. Kale plants are heavy feeders, requiring plentiful nitrogen to meet their growth requirements and develop optimally. Apply an appropriate complete fertilizer when thinning seedlings.

### Harvesting

Kale leaves can be harvested when they are 20–25 cm (8–10 in) long. Harvest the outer leaves to avoid damaging the growing tip of the plant. Kale leaves are sweeter when they are harvested after frost.

# Kiwi

## Description

Kiwi, Actinidia deliciosa, is a deciduous climbing vine or shrub in the the family Actinidiaceae grown for its edible fruits. The plant is vigorous and woody with nearly circular leaves which have long petioles and are alternately arranged on the stems. Young leaves and shoots are covered in tiny red hairs, while mature leaves are smooth and dark green on the upper surface and white and downy on lower surface. The kiwi plant produces fragrant white-yellow flowers singly or in clusters of 3 at the leaf axils (area between leaf and stem). The fruit is oval or ovoid in shape with green-brown skin covered in stiff brown hairs. The flesh of the fruit is bright green and juicy with many tiny black seeds. Kiwi plants can reach a height of 9 m (30 ft) and have an economic lifespan of 3 years, after which time fruit production begins to decline. Kiwi may also be referred to as kiwifruit or Chinese gooseberry and originates from China.

## Uses

Kiwis are primarily consumed as a fresh fruit.Basic requirements

Kiwi plants are native to warm, forest regions of China and require a long growing season with 8 to 9 month with no frost. The optimal temperature during the growing season is between 14 and 24°C (57.2–75.2°F). The plant can tolerate cold but is damaged by temperatures below -8°C (17.6°F). Some varieties of A. deliciosa, such as the Hayward cultivar will tolerate temperatures down to -10°C (14°F). In general, kiwifruit vines will grow best when planted in deep, well-draining, sandy loams as they are extremely sensitive to standing water. The optimum pH for the soil is between 5.5 and 6.0. In addition, kiwifruits require a plentiful supply of water during production and the vines require the support of a trellis to support the weight of the growing fruit. Kiwi should be planted in full sunlight to ensure optimal productivity.

## Propagation

Kiwis can be propagated by a variety of methods, including growing from seed or from hard or softwood cuttings or root cuttings. The easiest method of propagation is the use of softwood cuttings. The cuttings should be taken during the summer months when the tree is actively growing. Each cutting should be taken from the current season’s growth and should possess 2-3 nodes (leaves). The leaves must be fully expanded in order for the cutting to be successful, cuttings should not be taken from immature growth such as at the end of shoots. once the cuttings have been obtained, they should be stripped of all but the top-most leaf. Rooting hormone can be used to aid the cuttings in developing new roots. Those containing indole-3-butyric acid have been shown to be most effective in kiwi propagation. After treatment with rooting hormone, the kiwi cuttings should be planted in beds or small pots, preferably in a glasshouse, and kept moist. When the cuttings have began to develop new shoots, they should be transferred into 1 gallon pots containing a high quality potting soil and watered daily. The potted plants should be fed with a slow release fertilizer at least twice over the growing season.

### Planting

If the kiwi vines are to be grown on a trellis or pergola, this should be constructed prior to planting. Kiwi should be planted by digging a planting hole which is at least three times the width of the current pot that the plant is in. Individual plants should typically be spaced 5 m (16.4 ft) apart when using a T-trellis system but can be planted closer together when vines are managed by pruning. Approximately 6 m (19.6 ft) should be left between rows. This distance is again dependent on the training system being utilized. Almost all kiwi species are dioecious and require the presence of both a male and female tree in order to set fruit. The recommended planting ratio is 1 male to every 8 females but a higher density of male trees will increase productivity.

General care and maintenance

Kiwis have a high nutrient demand, particularly for nitrogen and potassium. after the first year of planting, plants should be fertilized in the Spring and as required throughout the growing season with the type and amount of fertilizer depending on the particular soil type and the age of the vines.

# Kohlrabi

## Description

Kohlrabi, Brassica oleracea var. gongylodes, is an herbaceous biennial grown for its edible stem. The kohlrabi plant has an erect stem which is swollen at the bottom, close to the soil. The swelling resembles a turnip in appearance, can reach up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and may be green, white or purple in color depending on the variety. The leaves of the plant grow from the stem and have long petioles and a waxy appearance. Kohlrabi can grow to a height of 40–50 cm (16–20 in) and although biennial, is commonly grown as an annual. Kohlrabi may also be referred to as turnip-rooted cabbage or German cabbage and originates from Europe.

## Uses

The kohlrabi stem is consumed after cooking as a vegetable. The leaves of the plant are also edible and are eaten after cooking similar to spinach or kale.Basic requirements

Kohlrabi a cool season crop which can be grown both in Spring and in Fall. The plants thrive in cool climates, maturing in cool or lightly frosty weather. In areas with hot summers, they should be planted for a Fall harvest. Kohlrabi will grow best in moist, fertile, well-draining soil with a slightly acidic pH between between 6.0 and 6.8 and at temperatures between 7 and 24°C (45–75°F). Temperatures below 7°C (45°F) will cause the plants to bolt. Kohlrabi has a high nitrogen requirement and due to the reduced activity of soil microbes in late fall and winter, organic matter should be added to the soil throughout the year to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients when sprouts are planted. Plant kohlrabi  in an area that receives at least six hours of full sunlight for optimum growth and development.

## Propagation

Kohlrabi can be direct seeded in the garden or started indoors to produce transplants. Seeds and transplants can be planted outdoors 1 to 2 weeks prior to the last frost date. For fall plantings, time seeding/transplanting so that plants mature no more than 2 to 3 weeks after the first frost date for the region. Seeds should be sown 0.6-1.9 in (0.25-0.75 in) deep. Direct seeded plants should be thinned when the plants have 3-4 true leaves. Transplants and thinned seedling should have a final spacing of 15 cm (6 in) between plants and 30.5 cm (12 in) between rows.

General care and maintenance

Kohlrabi has a shallow root system and should be watered regularly to keep the plants from drying out. Aim to apply 1 to 2 inches of water per week. Application of organic mulches will help to conserve water and keep the soil cool. Fertilizing kohlrabi plants with an appropriate nitrogen fertilizer helps to ensure rapid plant growth. Kohlrabi beds should be kept free from weeds, particularly when plants are young, by cultivating the soil around the plants. Care should be taken to avoid damage to the root system.

### Harvesting

Kohlrabi is ready to harvest when the stems reach 5 to 7.6 cm (2-3 in) in diameter. Stems harvested later tend to be tough and woody. Young leaves can be harvested during the growing season and prepared in the same way as kale.

# Lavender

## Description

Lavender is the name given to several species of herbaceous, perennial shrubs in the genus Lavandula which are grown as ornamental plants or for essential oil.  Lavender plants are small, branching and spreading shrubs with grey-green leaves and long flowering shoots. The leaves can be simple or pinnate measuring 30–50 mm (1–2 in) in length. The plant produces flowers on shoots or spikes which can be 20–40 cm (8–16 in) long. The flowers are lilac or blue in color.  Lavender can grow to 0.4 m (1.3 ft) in height and live for 20–30 years. Lavender may also be referred to as true lavender, medical lavender, smelling lavender, thin-leaved lavender or English lavender and is believed to originate from the Mediterranean, Middle East and India.

## Uses

Lavender flowers can be used in cooking as a herb or used to produce lavender sugar. Fresh flowers can be used as a flavoring in desserts and sauces. Bees which collect lavender nectar produce a high quality honey. Lavender is also cultivated as an ornamental plant or for the extraction of essential oil. The flower spikes are popularly dried and used in flower arranging.Basic requirements

Lavender grows very well in a wide range of climates, and optimally at temperatures between 7 and 21°C (44.6–69.8°F). Lavender plants require bright sunlight for adequate growth and should be positioned accordingly. The plants will grow best in light to sandy, well-draining soils with a pH of 5.8–8.3. The plants are drought tolerant once established but require regular watering while they establish.

## Propagation

Lavender is usually propagated vegetatively from cuttings or by dividing the mother plant. Cuttings are best taken directly after the plants bloom. The cuttings should be taken from stems with no flower buds and should be prepared for planting by removing the leaves at the bottom of the stem. The cuttings should then be planted in pots containing a high quality, sterile potting soil and watered regularly until they root. the cuttings should develop a root system of their own in approximately 3 weeks.

### Planting

Lavender plants can be planted Spring through to Fall. If planting in the Fall, care should be taken to use larger plants with an established root system to allow the plants to establish in the soil quickly before winter sets in. Spring planted lavender can be smaller as it can establish over the summer. Rooted cuttings can be planted directly in the garden after they have been hardened. Plants should be spaced 0.5–1.0 m (2–3 ft) apart depending on the variety, allowing 1–2 m (3–6 ft) between rows.

General care and maintenance

Once established, lavender requires little care. It benefits from prompt harvest if the flowers are to be used for further processing. Faded blooms should be removed to promote further blossoming. Light pruning encourages the plant to branch. Care should be taken not to over water the plants by allowing the plants to dry out between waterings.

### Harvesting

Flowerheads can be harvested from the plant at any time. Flowerheads to be used for the extraction of essential oil are best harvested when only 1/2 to 1/3 of the florets are open. Harvesting is usually done by hand but may be achieved mechanically in commercial production. after harvest, the flowers should be hung upside down in bunches to dry out.

- Symptoms: Wilting leaves; yellow leaves; dying leaves; discolored root tissue

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Disease favors cold wet soils

- Management: Management Avoid over-watering plants; plant lavender in well-draining soils


# Leek

## Description

Leek, Allium ampeloprasum, also known as Allium porrum, is a biennial vegetable in the family Liliaceae, grown for its edible bulb and leaves. The plant is a slightly developed bulb attached to a cylindrical stem formed by the overlapping thick, flat leaves. The plant can produce clusters of white, pink or purple flowers and blue-black seeds in the second year. The plant can reach 0.6–0.9 m (2–3 ft) and can be grown as an annual, harvested after one growing season or as a biennial with two growing seasons. Although modern leek does not grow wild, it was likely domesticated from wild ancestors in the Mediterranean region.

## Uses

Leeks are consumed as a vegetable after cooking and are incorporated into many dishes.Basic requirements

Leeks grow very well in cool climates and can be successfully grown in most soils as long as they are rich and well draining. Leek will grow optimally in a well-draining loam with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. Leek will grow optimally at temperatures between 18-21˚C (65-70˚F) with 8 hours of bright sunlight.

## Propagation

In areas with short growing seasons, leeks should be planted from transplants started indoors. Seeds should be planted at a depth of 0.6-1.3 cm (0.25-0.5 in) leaving 7.5-10 cm (3-4 in) between plants and allowing 20-40 cm (8-16 in) between rows. The soil should be moist to a depth of (18 in) and have reached a minimum temperature of 7˚C (45˚F) for successful germination. Transplants should be planted 5-8 cm (2-6 in) apart in rows spaced 30-90 cm (12-36 in) apart. In order to produce large stalks either plant the leek in a depression 7-10 cm (3-4 in) deep and gradually fill to the leaves. Alternatively, the leeks may be planted at ground level, with soil being added around the stalk throughout the season.

General care and maintenance

Leeks require regular watering for optimum development and should be provided with water once a week by soaking the soil to a depth of around 18 inches. Blanching leeks encourages the production of long white stalks. Blanching is achieved by gradually mounding the soil around the stalk to leaves. Blanching should not be carried out until the plants have reached an appropriate size - roughly that of a pencil. Leeks will benefit from the addition of nitrogen fertilizer throughout the growing season. fertilizer should be applied as a side dressing. Keep leek beds weed free by carefully cultivating around the plants taking care not to damage the leek roots.

### Harvesting

Leeks develop slowly and take about 100 and 120 days to reach maturity. Leeks are ready for harvest when the stalk has reach 3.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. Harvest by carefully loosening the plant with a garden fork and pulling from the soil.

## Common Pests and Diseases

# Lemon

## Description

Lemon, Citrus limon, is a small evergreen tree in the family Rutaceae grown for its edible fruit which, among other things, are used in a variety of foods and drinks. The tree has a spreading, upright growth habit, few large branches and stiff thorns. The tree possesses large, oblong or oval, light green leaves and produces purple-white flowers in clusters. The lemon fruit is an ellipsoid berry surrounded by a green rind, which ripens to yellow, protecting soft yellow segmented pulp. Lemon trees can reach 3–6 m (10–20 ft) in height and can live for many years, reaching full fruit bearing capacity in approximately 40 years. Lemon may also be referred to as bush lemon or Persian apple and likely originated from the eastern Himalaya of India.

## Uses

Due to their bitter taste, lemon fruit is not usually consumed fresh. It is used widely to make juices such as lemonade, as garnishes in cooking and as a flavoring in cooking and baking.Requirements

Lemon is a subtropical plant and the trees grow best in regions with a pronounced change in season. They will grow best at temperatures between 26–28°C (79–82°F) and are very sensitive to cold. Trees and fruit will be damaged or killed by freezing conditions without protection.The trees will tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water-logged soil. Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development. Lemon trees will grow best when positioned in full sunlight.

### Budding

Budding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6–9 mm/0.25–0.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant). Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden. The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which it will be joined. It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees. The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases which can kill trees. The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks which are 20–25 cm (8–10 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves. These budsticks can be stored for 2–3 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting.

The simplest way to join the budwood the the rootstock is by T-budding. The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut made approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground. Using a sharp knife, a 2.5–3.8 cm (1–1.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark. A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a “T-shape” The horizontal cut should be made a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark. Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud. This piece should measure 1.9–2.5 cm(0.75–1.0 in) in length. Immedietely insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant. Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape.

After the union has formed and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem 2.5–3.9 cm (1.0–1.5 in) above the join about 2/3 of the way through the stem on the same side as the join. The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground. This process, known as “lopping” allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in lengthe, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.

### Planting seedlings

Lemon trees can be purchased as seedlings which have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard. The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area. Trees should be planted at or higher than the level of the nursery pot. Once the tree is positioned in the planting hole, backfill the soil by about half and water to allow the soil to settle around the lower roots before filling in the hole. The newly planted tree should be watered every few days.

### General care

Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established. During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil. Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3–7 days. The soil should be moist, but not wet. Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently. Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month  in the first year. Lemon trees will need protected from cold temperatures to prevent damage. Soil can be mounded up around the trunk during the winter and removed in the Spring. Young trees can also be protected from frosts by covering them with tarps or blankets as required.

- Management: Management If the disease is introduced to an area, all infected trees should be removed and destroyed; in areas where disease is endemic, windbreaks can help to reduce disease severity; cultural control of the disease should focus on controlling leaf miner populations, utilizing wind breaks and applications of copper sprays.

#### Huanglongbing (Citrus greening, Yellow dragon disease) Candidatus Liberibacter asiativus Candidatus Liberibacter africanus Candidatus Liberibacter americanus

- Symptoms: Yellowing of one limb or one area of canopy; yellowing of leaf veins; blotchy mottling on leaf blades; twig and limb dieback; fruits dropping prematurely; small upwardly pointing leaves; small, misshapen fruit; fruit very bitter.

- Cause: Bacteria

- Comments: History Origins and spread Huanglongbing, or citrus greening, was first reported from Southern China in 1919 by American botanist Otto August Reinking who described a “yellow shoot” disease of citrus while evaluating diseases of economic plants in Southern China. A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of “huang long bing”, which translates to “yellow dragon disease”, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees. By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively. The disease has been known by various names in different countries - “greening” in South Africa, “mottle leaf” in the Philippines, “dieback” in India and “vein phloem degeneration” in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia. Biology and ecology The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant. The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter. It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L. africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L. asiaticus , found in .A third species, L. americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements. As this species is found in the same areas as L. asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements. Transmission Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar. Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius, Citrus psyllids Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew. Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed. They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers. When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days. In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur. It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments. Grafting Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956. The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.

- Management: Management Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured. Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus. Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified. In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms. (ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays. Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T. eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk. In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids.

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Tristeza disease Citrus tristeza virus (CTV)

- Symptoms: Light green foliage; poor new growth; leaves may be dropping from tree; young trees blooming early; severely infected trees are stunted and bushy in appearance with chlorotic leaves and brittle twigs; some strains of the virus cause elongated pits in the trunk and branches which give the wood a rope-like appearance.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Disease spread from infected grafting material or by aphids.

- Management: Management Quarantine procedures are used to control tristeza and prevent the pathogen from entering areas which are currently free of the disease.


# Lemon grass

## Description

Lemongrass, Cymbopogon citratus, is a perennial grass in the family Poaceae grown for its fragrant leaves and stalks which are used as a flavoring. The grass grows in dense clumps and has several stiff stems and slender blade-like leaves which droop towards the tips. The leaves are blue-green in color, turning red in the Fall and emit a strong lemon fragrance when damaged. Lemongrass produces large compound flowers on spikes when grown in the tropics, but rarely flowers when grown in more Northern latitudes. Lemon grass can reach a height of 1.8 m (6 ft) and will grow for several years, typically its economical lifespan is 4 years. Lemongrass may also be referred to as ginger grass or citronella grass and likely originates from Sri Lanka or Malaysia although a wild form of the plant is not known.

## Uses

The stalks (leaf bases) of the plant are commonly used to flavor dishes in Southeast Asian cooking. The heart of young shoots may be cooked and consumed as a vegetable. The tougher leaves are used to flavor dishes but are typically removed before serving. Leaves may also be used to make lemon grass tea. The essential oil extracted from the leaves is commonly used in insect repellents, perfumes and soaps.Basic requirements

Lemongrass is a tropical plant and as such will grow best in warm, sunny and humid conditions of the tropics and subtropics. The plants can be grown at temperatures ranging from 10 to 33°C (50-91.4°F) but will grow optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30°C (77–86°F). The grass will grow in a wide range of soils but grows best in well-draining, fertile loam with a pH between 5.0 and 8.4. The grass can also be successfully grown in containers. Plants can be successfully grown in full sun or partial shade.

## Propagation

As a clumping grass, lemongrass can be easily propagated by dividing stalks from the rhizome of a well established plant. The rhizome is best divided in the Spring in areas where the plant can be overwintered outdoors. In colder areas, the bulbous shoot base can be saved after harvest and stored for use the following Spring. The bulb can be divided prior to planting by slicing through the rhizome with a sharp spade or trowel. Ensure that each new plant has its own rootstock.

### Planting

Commercially grown lemongrass is planted at a higher density than in the home garden with a within row spacing of 20 cm (8 in) and 40 cm (16 in). In the home garden, plants should be spaced between 90 and 150 cm (36-60 in) apart. Prepare the soil for planting by working in 2 to 4 inches of compost.

General care and maintenance

Lemongrass requires regular rainfall and if being grown in drier climates the plants should be watered and misted regularly. Plants have a heavy requirement for nitrogen during the growing season and should be fertilized with a balanced soluble fertilizer once a month. Container grown plants should be fed more frequently. Lemongrass can grow very large and will quickly out compete weeds. However, younger plants should be kept free by carefully cultivating or hand pulling any weeds from around the plants.

### Harvesting

Lemongrass can be harvested at any time once the stalks have reached 1.3 cm (0.5 in) in diameter. Harvest stalks by cutting them at ground level with a sharp knife, or by bending the stalk and twisting.

- Management: Management Promote vigorous growth of plants by using mulches and fertilizer to stimulate growth; prune out diseased parts of plants to allow healthy regrowth; avoid overhead irrigation where possible


# Lentil

## Description

Lentil, Lens culinaris, is a a bushy, annual legume in the family Fabaceae grown for its edible seeds which are cooked and eaten.  The lentil plant is slender and erect or sub-erect and has branching, hairy stems. The leaves of the plant are arranged alternately and are made up of 4–7 individual oval leaflets.  The plant produces small blue, purple, white or pink flowers arranged on racemes with 1–4 flowers.  The seeds, or lentils, are produced within rhomboidal pods and can range in size from 2-9 mm (0.1–0.3 in) in diameter depending on the variety and can be red-orange, yellow, green or black in color. There are generally 1–2 lentils per pod. Lentil plants can reach 15–75 cm (6–30 in) in height and as annuals, survive only one growing season.  Lentil may also be referred to as red dhal or split pea and its origin is unknown although it is grown widely in Europe, Asia, and North Africa.

## Uses

The lentil seeds can be eaten raw or are cooked and eaten in soups and other dishes. They are commonly eaten as dahl (lentils seeds which have had the husk removed and then split).  Lentil seeds can be used as a source of starch for the textile industry or can be ground into flour.  The youger pods are sometimes eaten as vegetables.Basic requirements

Lentils are adapted to grow in cool climates and are tolerant of some light frost. Lentil plants can be grown on a wide variety of soils from sandy soils to clay loams but will grow optimally in a sandy, well-draining soil with a pH of 4.5 to 8.2. A soil pH of close to 7 is ideal. Lentils will be killed by waterlogged soil so good drainage is very important. Growing lentils on a South or East facing slope will help to warm the crop early in the growing season. The optimum temperature for their growth is approximately 24°C (75°F).  Lentils require and average rainfall of 10 to 12 inches per year but are fairly tolerant of drought although yield will be reduced. Yield will also be reduced by high humidity which promotes vegetative growth.

## Propagation

Lentils are propagated by seed and are either sown by broadcasting or by drilling in rows. Seed should be sown in soil which is firm and which has been prepared to a fine tilth. Seeds should be planted planted at a depth of 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in), leaving 20–30 cm (7.8–12 in) between individual plants and 15–18 cm (6–7 in) between rows. Due to the small size of the seeds, seedlings struggle to emerge if planted too deep in the soil. Commercial fields are planted at a rates of between 30 and 80 kg of seed per acre, depending on the variety, when lentil is the sole crop being grown. The best yields are achieved when lentil is planted by drilling which ensures a uniform planting depth. In many countries where lentil is commercially produced, lentils are intercropped with crops such as rice or barley and seeding rates are reduced accordingly.

General care and maintenance

Lentil seeds are often inoculated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria prior to planting. These bacteria nodulate the plants, allowing them to fix atmospheric nitrogen. found in the soil. lentils should be inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum within 24 hours of planting if the planting field was not previously used to grow lentils or other legumes. If the nitrogen level in the soil is low at time of planting then an early nitrogen supplement should be applied at a rate of 30 to 40 lb per acre. This ensures that the seedlings have enough nitrogen while the root nodules develop. Lentils have high requirements for sulfur, potassium and phosphorous and a soil test should be used to establish the level on these nutrients in the soil and thus the rate at which they should be applied if the soil is found to be deficient. Optimum soil tests range 15 to 30 ppm (30 to 60 lb/acre) for P and 90 to 120 ppm (180 to 240 lb/acre) for K for most soils. Lentils do not compete well with weeds and the planting site should be cleared by hoeing prior to the seeds being planted. Lentils should be kept evenly moist and watering should be ceased when the pods have begun to dry out.

### Harvesting

Lentils are ready to harvest when the plants turn yellow and the lower seed pods are yellow-brown in color. Plants should be watched carefully as this will happen over a period of a few days and the pods are easily shattered if left too long on the plants. Commercially grown lentil is harvested by swathing and the pods are threshed to collect the seeds. In the home garden, the pods can be picked from the plants or the whole plant can be gently pulled from the ground and set to dry on a rack for 1 to 2 weeks. The seeds can then be extracted from the dried pods by breaking them open and removing the seeds.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose Colletotrichum truncatum

- Symptoms: Tan lesions with darker borders on leaves which often appear prior to flowering or shortly after bloom; diseased leaves may drop from the plant prematurely; tan to light brown lesions appear on lower stems and begin to spread upwards, appearing higher on the plant; lesions may contain numerous black dots; as plant matures, the lesions expand and may cover large areas of the stem; lesions may also be present on pods and are light to tan brown with a dark margin; diseased pods often produced discolored seeds; disease can cause severe losses in yield

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence is favored by wet conditions; fungus is spread by splashing water; faba beans and filed peas are alternate hosts for the fungus

- Management: Management There are no varieties of lentil which are completely resistant to the disease but some are less susceptible than others and can be planted in areas where disease is prevalent; a well-timed application of an appropriate fungicide may be enough to control the disease but should be reapplied in the event of persistent wet weather

#### Ascochyta blight Ascochyta pinodella

- Symptoms: Tan to light brown lesions with a dark border can appear an any aerial part of the plant (leaves, stems, pods, petioles, peduncles); during periods of high humidity, numerous black dots may be visible in the center of the lesions; diseased plants may abort flowers and/or fruits; seeds may be discolored

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease can be transmitted to seedlings from infected seeds; foliar transmission is favored by cool, moist soils

- Management: Management Plant only disease-free seed or seed treated with a fungicide prior to planting; rotate crop away from lentil for a period of three years; remove and destroy all lentil crop residue after harvest to reduce the levels of inoculum the following growing season; a single application of an appropriate foliar fungicide is usually enough to control the disease but should be reapplied during persistent wet weather

#### Powdery mildew Erysiphe pisi

- Symptoms: Yellow spots on upper surface of leaves; powdery gray-white areas which coalesce to cover entire plant; if plant is heavily infected it may appear light blue or gray in color

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters on plant debris or alternate host; disease emergence is favored by warm, dry weather with cool nights that result in dew formation

- Management: Management Plant resistant varieties, particularly if sowing late; use overhead irrigation (washes fungus from leaves and reduces viability); plant crop as early as possible; frequent applications of sulfur may be required to control heavy infestations


# Lettuce

## Description

Lettuce, Lactuca sativa, is a leafy herbaceous annual or biennial plant in the family Asteraceae grown for its leaves which are used as a salad green.  The lettuce plant can vary greatly in size, shape and leaf type but generally, the leaves of the plant form a dense head or loose rosette. The stem of the plant is short, with larger leaves arranged at the bottom and becoming progressively smaller further up the stem. Leaves can be smooth or curly and are usually green or red in color.  The lettuce plant can grow to a height of 30–100 cm (12–40 in) in height and is typically grown as an annual, harvested after only one growing season.  Lettuce may be referred to as garden lettuce and is believed to originate from Asia Minor and the Middle East.

## Uses

Lettuce is primarily eaten raw as a salad green. Some varieties can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable.Requirements

Lettuce is a cool season crop which will grow optimally at daytime temperatures of 15–20°C (59–68°F). The plant can be grown in a wide range of soils as long as it is fertile and moisture retaining due to the small root system of the plant. It is often grown in alkaline soil (pH greater than 7.0) but will not tolerate acid soil. Heat tolerant varieties can be grown over the summer months and care should be taken to protect the leaves from strong sun by shading or covering to prevent the plants from bolting.

### Sowing seeds

Lettuce seeds can be sown directly in the garden or field as soon as the soil can be worked as the seeds will germinate at temperatures of 4.4°C (40°F) and above and seedlings will tolerate a light frost. Seeds should be sown 0.3–0.6 cm (1/8–1/4 in) deep and 2.5 cm (1 in) apart, leaving 50 cm (20 in) between rows. Cover the seeds lightly, tamp the soil and water the seeds. Seedlings should emerge in 2–15 days. When the plants have 2–3 true leaves then they should be thinned to a final spacing of 25–45 cm (10 to 18 in) depending on the variety. Plant new seeds every 2–3 weeks for a continuous harvest.

### Transplants

Sow seeds in seedling trays in a sterile seed starting mix at a rate of approximately 3–4 seeds per inch (2.5 cm). Young plants can be potted up into larger pots or cell trays when they are about 2 weeks old. Plant transplants in the garden after hardening off, spacing plants 25–45 cm (10 to 18 in) (depending on variety) and allowing 50 cm (20 in) between rows. Plant new seeds every 2–3 weeks for a continuous harvest.

# Lime, sour

## Description

Lime, Citrus aurantifolia, is a small perennial evergreen tree in the family Rutaceae grown for its sour fruit.  The lime tree is irregularly branched and possesses sharp spines. The leaves of the tree are  elliptical with small rounded teeth around the edge. The leaves can grow 4–8 cm (1.6–3.2 in) in length. The tree produces small, cupped white flowers and yellowish-green fruit which is round or egg-like in shape. Lime trees  can reach 5 m (16 ft) in height and can produce fruit for many years. Lime may also be referred to as sour lime, key lime, Mexican lime, acid lime or West Indian lime and originated in southeast Asia.

## Uses

Lime fruit is commonly used to make juices and cordials or for extraction of citric acid. It may be used as a flavoring in cooking.  Lime oil can be extracted from the peel of the fruit.Requirements

Lime is a tropical plant and the trees grow best in regions with hot summers and warm winters where temperatures are typically between 25 and 30°C (77–86°F). Limes are more sensitive to cold than lemons and trees are killed by freezing conditions without protection. Lime trees are the most drought tolerant of all citrus trees conditions and will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development. Lime trees will grow best when positioned in full sunlight.

### Lime propagation

Unlike many other fruit bearing trees, limes are commonly propagated from seed as the will produce offspring that is true to the parent plant. In some cases, trees are propagated by removing offshoots from the main trunk (called suckers) and replanting although, if the tree is grafted, it should be noted that the suckers will be the same variety of the rootstock.

### Planting seedlings

The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area. Trees should be planted at or higher than the level of the nursery pot. Once the tree is positioned in the planting hole, backfill the soil by about half and water to allow the soil to settle around the lower roots before filling in the hole. The newly planted tree should be watered every few days.

### General care

Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established. During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil. Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3–7 days. The soil should be moist, but not wet. Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently. Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month  in the first year. Lime trees will need protected from cold temperatures to prevent damage. Soil can be mounded up around the trunk during the winter and removed in the Spring. Trees can also be protected by stringing christmas lights in the branches and covering the leaves with tarps. In areas with cold winters, lime trees are best grown in containers which allows them to be moved indoors during the winter months.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose Colletotrichum gloeosporioides

- Symptoms: Leaves dropping prematurely; leaves covered in dark fungal spores; red to green or black streaks on the mature fruits.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors warm temperatures.

- Management: Management If the disease is introduced to an area, all infected trees should be removed and destroyed; in areas where disease is endemic, windbreaks can help to reduce disease severity; cultural control of the disease should focus on controlling leaf miner populations, utilizing wind breaks and applications of copper sprays.

### Disease Category: Other

#### Huanglongbing (Citrus greening, Yellow dragon disease) Candidatus Liberibacter asiativus Candidatus Liberibacter africanus Candidatus Liberibacter americanus

- Symptoms: Yellowing of one limb or one area of canopy; yellowing of leaf veins; blotchy mottling on leaf blades; twig and limb dieback; fruits dropping prematurely; small upwardly pointing leaves; small, misshapen fruit; fruit very bitter

- Cause: Bacteria

- Comments: History Origins and spread Huanglongbing, or citrus greening, was first reported from Southern China in 1919 by American botanist Otto August Reinking who described a “yellow shoot” disease of citrus while evaluating diseases of economic plants in Southern China. A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of “huang long bing”, which translates to “yellow dragon disease”, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees. By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively. The disease has been known by various names in different countries - “greening” in South Africa, “mottle leaf” in the Philippines, “dieback” in India and “vein phloem degeneration” in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia. Biology and ecology The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant. The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter. It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L. africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L. asiaticus , found in .A third species, L. americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements. As this species is found in the same areas as L. asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements. Transmission Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar. Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius, Citrus psyllids Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew. Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed. They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers. When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days. In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur. It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments. Grafting Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956. The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.

- Management: Management Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured. Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus. Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified. In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms. (ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays. Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T. eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk. In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids.

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Tristeza virus Citrus tristeza virus (CTV)

- Symptoms: Light green foliage; poor new growth; leaves may be dropping from tree; young trees blooming early; severely infected trees are stunted and bushy in appearance with chlorotic leaves and brittle twigs; some strains of the virus cause elongated pits in the trunk and branches which give the wood a rope-like appearance

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Disease spread from infected grafting material or by aphids

- Management: Management Quarantine procedures are used to control tristeza and prevent the pathogen from entering areas which are currently free of the disease


# Macadamia

## Description

Macadamia trees belong to the genus Macadamia which contains four species of tree or shrub in the family Proteaceae which are grown for their edible seeds (nuts). Cultivated macadamia is a derivative of the subtropical species' Macadamia integrifoia and Macadamia tetraphylla and their hybrids. Macadamia plants naturally have multiple stems but are trained to a central leader system (single stem) in plantations. The leaves of the trees are oval or oblong and are arranged in whorls of 3 or 4 depending on variety. The tree produces creamy white or pink-red flowers on racemes of 100–300 flowers and a rounded fleshy fruit up to 27 mm (1 in) in diameter. The flesh covers a single spherical or elliptical seed (nut) with a white or gray kernel depending on the variety of tree. Macadamia can reach a height of 20 m (65.6 ft) and have a commercial lifespan of 40–60 years. Macadamia may also be referred to as Queensland nut or Australian nut and originates from Australia.

## Uses

The kernels of the macadamia nut are mainly consumed as a snack food. The kernels from M. integrifolia and M. tetraphylla can be eaten raw from the shell while the remaining Macadamia species contain toxins which must be removed prior to consumption. Macadamia may also be used in baked goods and confectionery.Basic requirements

Macadamia trees originate from the sub-tropical rainforests of Australia and therefore tend to grow best in areas of high humidity and high rainfall. They will grow optimally at average annual temperatures between 20 and 25°C (68–77°F) in a deep, well draining loam and sandy loam with a pH between 5.0 and 5.5. Trees should not be planted in heavy clays. It is recommended that macadamia only be planted in frost free areas, young trees will be killed by temperatures of -6°C (21°F) although older, established trees can tolerate some light frost.

### Transplanting

When planting numerous macadamia trees in a plantation, consideration must be given to drainage, irrigation, row alignment and wind protection. Planting distances tend to be site specific and are dependent on factors such as the macadamia variety, soil and rainfall. In general, macadamia trees are planted 4 to 8 m (13-26 ft) apart within a row, allowing 7 to 11 m (23-36 ft) between rows. Young trees are planted in Spring and Fall by digging holes which are 45 cm deep and 60 cm in diameter. Once the tree is in position, the hole is backfilled with soil. it is recommended that some compost and rock phosphate be added to the backfill at time of planting. The soil around the tree should then be gently tamped and the tree watered. Staking will help to protect the young trees from wind damage. Grafted trees usually begin to produce fruit 3 years after planting.

General care and maintenance

During the first four years after planting, animal manure and a thick layer of organic mulch can be applied around the trees year round. after this period, the amount of manure added should be decreased to prevent the trees being provided with too much nitrogen and being deficient in potassium. In the first 4 years following planting, vegetative growth should be stimulated through pruning. Once the leading shoot has reached a height of approximately 80 cm (31.5 in) it should be clipped to stimulate branching. Established trees are usually pruned in the Spring when old, unproductive and diseased branches are removed from the canopy. Any nuts remaining on the tree should also be removed. Mulches are best applied after nut harvest to allow the material to decompose before the next crop. Avoid piling mulch up against the trunks to prevent disease.

### Harvesting

Grafted trees will begin to produce a crop 3 years after planting but it is not until the 7th year that the crop will be of any economic significance. Trees will give maximum yields 15 to 20 years after planting. Nuts should be collected when they fall from the tree and this should be done every 1-2 weeks during the nut producing periods. In commercial plantations, nuts can be collected mechanically or by hand.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

- Comments: Encourage predatory birds such as owls by providing nesting boxes in the trees

- Management: Management All food sources for rats should be removed from the orchard, this includes old nuts, nut waste and wild tobacco; remove any rat nests from trees; keep grass around trees mown short and, if possible, maintain a clear mown area around the orchard to deter rats from entering and to aid predators such as owls in detecting and hunting rats


# Maize (corn)

## Description

Maize is a staple food for almost half the population of sub-Saharan Africa and is important for its carbohydrate, proteins, iron, vitamin B, and minerals. The produce is consumed as maize meal (ugali), porridge, pastes, and beer, and can be boiled or roasted as fresh as it comes from the farm. Maize is also processed to produce oils for cooking. It is also an important crop for animal feed.

Smallholder farmers are the largest producers of maize in sub-Saharan Africa. The maize is produced through subsistence farming as part of mixed agricultural systems which lack inputs such as fertiliser, irrigation, improved seeds and efficient labor.

In 2017, Africa produced 7.4% of the 1,135 million tonnes produced worldwide in 40 million hectares, according to data by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Zea mays

Common Name: "Mahindi" in Swahili, "maíz" in Spanish, "maïs" in French, "Mais" in German, "grano" or "mais" in Italian, "milho" in Portuguese, "玉米" (yùmǐ) in Chinese, "मक्का" (makkā) in Hindi, "ذرة" (dhira) in Arabic, and "кукуруза" (kukuruza) in Russian

## Uses & Benefits

Maize is a versatile crop with numerous uses and benefits. It serves as a staple food providing essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Maize is also a key ingredient in various food products, including cornmeal, corn syrup, and cooking oil. Beyond its nutritional value, maize is used in animal feed, supporting livestock production. It is a vital raw material in industries producing biofuels, biodegradable plastics, and other industrial products.

## Varieties

The history of maize varieties in the continent spans way back in 1500 AD when the crop was introduced in Africa and spread in every corner of the continent. Today, there are about 50 species with different texture, color, grain sizes and shapes. White and yellow maize are the most commonly cultivated, and production of seed varieties depends on the region’s soil and climatic conditions.

PlantVillage recommends use of certified seeds suitable for appropriate soil and climatic conditions.

Here are some of the maize varieties grown in Kenya:

H614: this is a white maize variety that is popular in Kenya due to its high yield potential, good grain quality, and tolerance to diseases such as maize streak virus.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Maize is a versatile crop that can grow in different varieties of soil, water, and climatic conditions. The crop has a wide range of tolerance to temperature conditions but grows well in warm regions where moisture is sufficient. The crop flourishes in regions with rainfall ranging from 1200mm to 2500mm but can adapt to regions receiving rainfall of up to 400 mm. The crop requires warm temperatures of between 15°C and 30 °C and thrives in a range of zones with altitudes ranging from 100 m to 2900 m ASL, depending on the variety.

The crop is sensitive to moisture stress around tasseling time and during cob formation. Growth is favorable under a pH ranging from 5-8 with 5.5-7 being optimal because it is sensitive to salinity.

### Growing from Seed

The first step to getting maximum yield is ensuring you plant healthy, certified seeds. Apart from the varieties shown above, H614, H626, and H627 for attitudes ranging from 1500 to 2100 M ASL; KATUMANI, DH O2, DH O4, and Drought TEGO for attitudes ranging from 600 to 1300 M ASL; H 513, H 511, and H 516 for attitudes ranging from 800 to 1500 M ASL; and PH1, PH4 for attitudes ranging from 0 to 1200 M ASL are some of the other seed varieties planted in East Africa.

The piece of land for planting maize should be prepared early, before the onset of rains, for weeds to decompose before planting. The following procedure for planting can be followed:

Spray weeds with the appropriate chemicals.

Plough the land and make it level with a fine tilth. Considering the size of the land, machines like tractors or ox-drawn ploughs can be used, observing the correct spacing.

Mix soil with manure and biochar for efficient and improved nutrient uptake as well as stabilizing soil pH.

Make holes at a spacing of 90 x 30–50 cm if soil fertility is low or 75 x 25–50 cm if soil fertility is relatively high.

Place 1 or 2 seeds per hole, or alternate 1 and 2 seeds at a depth of about 4 cm if the soil is moist and about 10 cm if the soil is dry.

Cover the seeds with loose soil.

It is important to plant maize early in the season because late planting adversely affects yield. Plant within two weeks of the onset of rainfall in the highlands and before the onset of rainfall in the lowlands to make use of the scarce rainfall.

### General Care and Maintenance

Gapping is done to replace seeds that did not germinate after others germinated completely. Thinning is done when maize has grown to about 15 cm in height by removing weak and deformed seedlings to make space for healthy seedlings in a hole.

To achieve maximum yield, fertilizer should be applied on time. Manure and biochar can also be added to soil with little or no organic matter. When planting manually, thoroughly mix soil with a teaspoonful of fertilizer into each planting hole to ensure that it doesn’t burn the seeds. Place the seeds on top of the soil and feel for softness. DAP is recommended for planting because it contains phosphorous, which helps in root development.

Maize can be top dressed with CA 2-3 weeks after planting or when it is 45 cm (1 ft) high. One teaspoon of fertilizer should be applied to the base of each plant, 15 cm away from the plant in a ring or along the row. Top dress in two stages in areas with heavy rainfall: the first six weeks after sowing and the second 10-15 days later, or just before tussling. In areas experiencing low rainfall, topdressing is done only once at a rate of 50–100 kg per acre. Using CAN and urea for topdressing is good because it fixes nitrogen in the soil. Nitrogen increases the green color of the leaves to make food for the plant.

Remove weeds mechanically, manually, or by using herbicides to prevent them from competing with the crops for nutrients, water, and light. First weeding, if done manually, should be done three weeks after planting, depending on the intensity of weeds in the field. Herbicides can be applied in two phases: pre- emergence, which is used before the maize germinates and weeds appear, and post-emergence, which is applied after the maize and weeds germinate.

### Harvesting

Normally, each maize stalk should yield one large ear of maize, but in ideal conditions, the stalk can yield a second, slightly smaller ear that matures slightly later than the first. Maize is ready for harvesting when the kernels within the husks are well packed and produce a milky substance when the kernel is punctured.

## Physiological Diseases

Nitrogen deficiency The typical symptom of nitrogen deficiency is the plant turns pale green; a ‘V’ shaped yellow coloration on leaves. This pattern starts from leaf end to leaf collar. The symptom begin from lower to upper leaves.

Phosphorous deficiency The deficient plants are dark green and lower leaves show reddish-purple discoloration.

Potassium deficiency The leaf margins turn yellow and brown which appears like firing or drying. The symptoms progress from lower leaves to upper leaves.

Sulfur deficiency Symptom appears on younger leaves where we will see yellow color striping(interveinal chlorosis).

Zinc deficiency Upper leaves shows broad bands of yellow coloration and later turn pale brown or gray necrosis(dead-spots). The symptom first appears in the middle of leaves and progress outward.

#### Charcoal rot Macrophomina phaseolina

- Symptoms: Symptoms are usually first apparent at the tasseling stage; plant stalks become shredded and pith is completely rotted with stringy strands of vascular tissue left intact; small, black fungal fruiting bodies are visible in the vascular strands and give the tissue a gray coloration; fungus grows into internodes of the stalk causing the plant to ripen early and causing the stalk to weaken; plant may break.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Emergence of the disease is favored by warm soils with a low moisture content; fungus overwinters in the soil and can also survive on other host plants which include sorghum and soybean.

- Management: Management There are currently no available fungicides to treat the disease; avoid stressing plants by practicing good water management; rotating crops with small grains may help reduce disease incidence.

#### Common rust Puccinia sorghi

- Symptoms: Oval or elongated cinnamon brown pustules on upper and lower surfaces of leaves; pustules rupture and release powdery red spores; pustules turn dark brown-black as they mature and release dark brown powdery spores; if infection is severe, pustules may appear on tassels and ears and leaves may begin to yellow; in partially resistant corn hybrids, symptoms appear as chlorotic or necrotic flecks on the leaves which release little or no spore.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease is spread by wind-borne spores; some of the most popularly grown sweet corn varieties have little or no resistance to the disease.

- Management: Management The most effective method of controlling the disease is to plant resistant hybrids; application of appropriate fungicides may provide some degree on control and reduce disease severity; fungicides are most effective when the amount of secondary inoculum is still low, generally when plants only have a few rust pustules per leaf.

#### Common smut (Boil smut, Blister smut) Ustilago zeae

- Symptoms: Tumor-like galls on plant tissues which are initially green-white or silvery white in color; interior of galls darken and turn into masses of powdery dark brown or black spores (with the exception of galls on leaves which remain greenish in color); galls may reach up to 15 cm in diameter and are common on ears, tassels, shoots or midrib of leaves; galls on leaves remain small and do not burst open.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters on crop debris or in the soil and can survive for several years; fungus usually enters the plant through wounds; application of nitrogen fertilizer increases incidence of disease, while application of phosphorous fertilizer decreases infection.

- Management: Management Although many practices may be recommended for the control of common smut, the only method that is completely effective is to grow resistant corn hybrids.

#### Downy Mildew disease Peronosclerospora sorghi (Sorghum downy mildew) P. maydis (Java downy mildew) P. philippinensis (Philippine downy mildew) P. sacchari (Sugarcane downy mildew) Scleropthora rayssiae var. zeae (Brown stripe downy mildew) Sclerospora graminicola (Graminicola downy mildew or green ear) Sclerophthora macrospora (crazy top)

- Symptoms: Symptoms of all maize downy mildew pathogens are similar although may vary depends on cultivar, age and climate. The disease appear as early from two weeks after sowing resulting in chlorosis and stunting. In older plants the leaves shows mottling, chlorotic streaking and lesions and white striped leaves. Usually the leaves are narrower and more erect when compare to healthy plants and are covered with a white, downy growth on both surfaces.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: The disease is both air and seed born. The pathogen have several alternative hosts.

- Management: Management Grow available resistant varieties and hybrids. Follow crop rotation with non host crops. Use suitable systemic fungicide for both seed treatment and foliar spray. Keep the fields free from weeds. Drying seeds before sowing reduces the disease incidence.

#### Giberrella stalk and ear rot Giberella zeae

- Symptoms: Plants wilting and leaves changing color from light to dull green; lower stalk turns straw yellow; internal stalk tissue breaks down; interior of stalk has a red discoloration; black fungal fruiting bodies may be visible on the stalk, often at internodes, and can be easily scraped off; if fungal infection affects the ears, it produces a red mold at the tips of the ear which spreads down; early infection may result in the ear being covered in pink mycelium which causes the corn husk to adhere to the ear.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus can enter through wounds to stalk or ear; ear rot is caused by the fungus infecting silks and moving down through the ear; fungus survives on corn debris in soil and on debris of other host plants such as wheat.

- Management: Management Stressed plants are more susceptible to Gibberella - providing adequate fertilization and irrigation can help reduce incidence of disease; control insects, especially stem and ear borers; hybrids differ in their susceptibility to the disease and further information is required in order to develop specific control measures.

#### Northern Leaf Blight Exserohilum turcicum

- Symptoms: In the beginning we will notice elliptical gray-green lesions on leaves. As the disease process this lesions become pale gray to tan color. Later stage the lesions looks dirty due to dark gray spores particularly under lower leaf surface. The disease can be easily identified in the field due to its long, narrow lesions which are unrestricted by veins.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: The disease mainly spread through rain splash and wind.

- Management: Management Follow proper tillage to reduce fungus inoculum from crop debris. Follow crop rotation with non host crop. Grow available resistant varieties. In severe case of disease incidence apply suitable fungicide.

#### Southern corn leaf blight Bipolaris maydis

- Symptoms: Foliar symptoms vary with hybrid and different fungal isolate; lesions on leaves may be tan and elongated and run between leaf veins; lesions may have a buff or brown colored margin; another race of the fungus causes tan, spindle shaped or elliptical lesions with a water-soaked margin that turns into a yellow halo.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters in corn debris in soil; disease occurs worldwide but is emergence favors areas with a warm, damp climate.

- Management: Management The most effective method of controlling the disease is to plant resistant hybrids; cultural control methods include plowing crop debris into soil after harvest and rotating crops.

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial leaf blight/stripe Pseudomonas rubrilineans, syn. Pseudomonas avenae, Acidvorax avenae subsp. avenae

- Symptoms: Water-soaked linear lesions on leaves as they emerge; lesions turn brown and may subsequently turn gray or white; lesions may have a red border; after the leaves are mature, lesions do not tend to extend any further; no new lesions tend to appear after tasseling; if corn variety is susceptible, mature leaves may shred after maturity.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Bacteria can also cause disease in oats, barley, wheat, some millets and sorghum.

- Management: Management Resistant hybrids should be planted in areas where the disease is prevalent; plowing crop debris into soil and rotating crop may not be effective at controlling the disease due to its extensive host range.

#### Bacterial Leaf Streak disease Xanthomonas vasicola pv. vasculorum (syn Xanthomonas campestris pv. zeae)

- Symptoms: The infected leaves initially shows narrow stripes between the veins. The initial symptoms are generally confused with gray leaf spot disease. But the lesions from bacteria appear brown, orange, and/or yellow when you infected leaves are back-lit. Also in Bacterial Leaf Streak disease the lesions show slightly wavy edges when compared to the smooth, linear lesion margins of gray leaf spot.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: The bacteria causes gumming disease on sugarcane in several part of the world. First reported on corn in South Africa. Currently this disease is reported in Nebraska (Aug. 26, 2016), Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas on corn.

- Management: Management Use healthy and disease free seeds. Remove the infected plant debris and burn them. Follow crop rotation.

#### Bacterial stalk rot/soft rot Erwinia chrysanthemi Erwinia carotovora

- Symptoms: Plants suddenly beginning to lodge (bend to lie along the ground) midway through season; one or more internodes above soil line turning brown, water- soaked, soft and slimy; tissue has foul odor and mushy appearance;

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease is most commonly found in plantations which have overhead irrigation systems or in areas with high rainfall; disease emergence is favored by high temperatures and high humidity.

- Management: Management Plow all crop debris into soil in Fall; plant corn in well-draining soil to prevent waterlogged plants.

#### Goss's bacterial blight Clavibacter michiganensis

- Symptoms: Gray or yellow stripes with irregular margins on leaf surfaces; stripes follow leaf veins and contain characteristic dark green to black water-soaked spots; if infection occurs early then plant may become wilted or withered; it is common to find a crystalline residue on leaves caused by dried bacterial exudate.

- Cause: Bacteria

- Comments: Disease overwinters in diseased crop debris on, or close to, the soil surface; temperatures below 12°C (53.6°F) and above 40°C (104°F) bacterium grows more slowly and may even be killed off.

- Management: Management Plant resistant sweetcorn hybrids; rotate crop; plow crop debris into soil immediately after harvest.

#### Holcus spot Pseudomonas syringae

- Symptoms: Circular or elliptical spots 2-10 mm across near the tips of lower leaves which are dark green and water soaked initially but become cream to tan before turning dry and brown; lesions may have red-brown margins; large lesions may have a yellow halo.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease can occur anywhere where corn is grown but is not usually very damaging.

- Management: Management Disease is usually not severe but if it does become a problem crops should be rotated and any debris should be plowed into the soil after harvest.

#### Stewart’s wilt Erwinia stewartii syn Pantoea stewartii

- Symptoms: The main symptoms are appearance of water soaked lesions initially. As the disease progress the lesions become long and turn pale yellow with irregular margins running in the length. The pathogen may infect the stem and causes stunting, wilting and death of plant.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: The pathogen is mainly transmitted by maize flea beetles and to lesser extent by infected seeds.

- Management: Management Grow available resistant varieties. Use certified healthy seeds. Remove the crop debris and burn them. Use suitable insecticide to control flea beetle.

#### Maize dwarf mosaic Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV)

- Symptoms: Chlorotic spots and streaks on leaves which develop into a mottled or mosaic pattern; susceptible plants may be stunted; ear formation and development cease; mosaic and mottling with no red discoloration are characteristic symptoms of the disease.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Virus is transmitted by more than 15 different species of aphid and is passed to the plant from the insect in seconds to minutes of feeding; sorghum is also a major host of the virus.

- Management: Management Many commercial corn hybrids are highly tolerant of the disease and no control is needed; control aphid populations on plants and remove any Johnson grass growing in the vicinity as it can act as a reservoir for the virus.

#### Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND) or Corn Lethal Necrosis (CLN) Maize Chlorotic Mottle Virus (MCMoV) + Sugarcane Mosaic Virus (SCMV)/ Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV)/Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV)

- Symptoms: The disease occurs at all stages of crop. The main symptoms includes appearance of chlorotic mottling on leaves which starts from base and extends upwards. Also the leaves shows necrosis at margins which later extends to mid rib and results in drying of entire leaf. The necrosis of young leaves in the whorl causes dead heart symptom. Other symptoms are premature plant death, shortened male inflorescences with few spikes, and/or shortened, malformed, partially filled ears.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: The virus mainly spread by vectors (maize thrips, aphids, rootworms and leaf beetles) and infected seeds. The first report of this disease in Africa continent was in Kenya (2011). And later the disease spreads to other countries like Tanzania, Uganda and South Sudan.

- Management: Management Use healthy, disease free certified seeds. Keep the fields free from weeds. Remove the infected plants and burn them. Control vectors by treating seed and/ foliar spray with suitable insecticide. Follow crop rotation with non cereals at least for two seasons. Plant maize only in main rainy season instead of short rainy season. Grow available resistant varieties.

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Pythium root rot Pythium spp.

- Symptoms: Above-ground, plants may be yellow and stunted; roots have obvious lesions and roots are discolored; root cortex will come away when pulled gently, exposing the white stele; can also cause damping-off of seedlings.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters in soil and crop debris; disease emergence is favored by high soil moisture and low temperatures leading to low soil oxygen levels.

- Management: Management Control of the disease relies on improving soil drainage or planting corn in areas where the soil is well-draining; systemic fungicides can be used to treat seed prior to planting to protect seedlings from disease.

### Disease Category: Other

#### Slugs Various

- Symptoms: Irregularly shaped holes in leaves and stems; leaves may be shredded; slime trails present on rocks, walkways, soil and plant foliage; several slug species are common garden and field pests; slugs are dark gray to black in color and can range in size from 2.5 to 10 cm (1-4 in).

- Cause: Mollusc

- Comments: Slugs prefer moist, shaded habitats and will shelter in weeds or organic trash; adults may deposit eggs in the soil throughout the season; damage to plants can be extensive.

- Management: Management Practice good garden sanitation by removing garden trash, weeds and plant debris to promote good air circulation and reduce moist habitat for slugs and snails; handpick slugs at night to decrease population; spread wood ashes or eggshells around plants; attract molluscs by leaving out organic matter such as lettuce or grapefruit skins, destroy any found feeding on lure; sink shallow dishes filled with beer into the soil to attract and drown the molluscs; chemical controls include ferrous phosphate for organic gardens and metaldehyde (e.g. Buggeta) and carbaryl (e.g Sevin bait) for non-organic growers.


# Mandarin oranges

## Description

Mandarin is the group name given to several classes of small oranges that includes mandarins, satsumas, clementines and tangerines which all belong to the species Citrus reticulata and the satsuma mandarin Citrus unshiu. Generally, mandarin trees are small and spiny with long, slender branches. They can have an erect or drooping growth habit depending on variety. The leaves of the trees are lanceolate and may be hairless or toothed with narrowly winged petioles. The trees produce flowers singly or in clusters and globose fruits with a bright orange to red-orange peel and segmented orange flesh. Mature mandarin trees can reach 7–8 m 23–26 ft in height and can be very long lived if they do not succumb to disease. Mandarins originate from Southeast Asia.

## Uses

Mandarin oranges are commonly eaten fresh or may be processed for canned segments. They can be pressed or squeezed to produce juice which is used in many beverages. Mandarin essential oil is used as a flavoring in alcoholic drinks.Requirements

Mandarin oranges are subtropical plants and the trees grow best in regions with a pronounced change in season. They will grow best at temperatures between 12.8 and 37.8°C (55–100°F) during the growing season and 1.7 to 10°C (35–50°F) during dormancy. Mature mandarin orange trees can survive short periods of freezing, whereas young trees will be killed. Fruit will also be damaged by freezing conditions. The trees will tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water-logged soil. Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development. Mandarin orange trees require full sun and should be protected from wind.

Mandarin oranges propagation

Mandarin orange seedlings are usually produced by grafting or budding to an appropriate rootstock as seeds will not produce fruit true to type. Grafting is the process by which a scion from plant is joined to the rootstock of another to produce a new tree. Budding is a special type of grafting where the scion that is joined to the rootstock consists of a single bud. Budding is commonly used in citrus propagation as it is the easier of the two processes and works very well. Common rootstocks for grafting and budding of citrus trees include sour orange and rough lemon.

### Budding

Budding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6–9 mm/0.25–0.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant). Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden. The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which it will be joined. It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees. The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases which can kill trees. The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks which are 20–25 cm (8–10 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves. These budsticks can be stored for 2–3 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting.

The simplest way to join the budwood the the rootstock is by T-budding. The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut made approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground. Using a sharp knife, a 2.5–3.8 cm (1–1.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark. A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a “T-shape” The horizontal cut should be made a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark. Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud. This piece should measure 1.9–2.5 cm(0.75–1.0 in) in length. Immedietely insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant. Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape.

After the union has formed and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem 2.5–3.9 cm (1.0–1.5 in) above the join about 2/3 of the way through the stem on the same side as the join. The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground. This process, known as “lopping” allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in length, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.

### Planting seedlings

Mandarin orange trees can be purchased as seedlings which have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard. The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area. Standard sized trees should be spaced 3.7–7.6 m (12–25 ft) apart in an area that receives full sunlight, but is protected from strong winds which can damage the trees. Planting against a south facing wall will help protect the tree in cooler climates.

### General care

Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established. During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil. Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3–7 days. The soil should be moist, but not wet. Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently. Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month  in the first year

# Mango

## Description

Mango is an evergreen tree in the Anacardiaceae family that is grown for its edible fruit. It has a dark, glossy, elliptical, or lanceolate leaf with long petioles and a leathery texture. It produces dense clusters of flowers with cream-pink petals.

Mango fruit is roughly oval in shape, with uneven sides. The fruit is a drupe, with an outer flesh surrounding a stone. The flesh is soft and yellow-orange in color. The fruit's skin ranges from yellow-green to red. Mango trees can reach a height of 45 meters (148 feet) and live for more than a century. Mango is thought to have originated in India or Burma (Myanmar).

Mangoes are produced in most parts of Africa including Kenya, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, and Ivory Coast. In Kenya, it is produced in Garissa, Kitui, Murang'a, Elgeyo Marakwet, Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale, Garissa, Makueni, Taita Taveta, Tharaka Nithi, Embu but Ukambani leads in production.

The mango tree is always green and its fruits varied in size, some are round, and some are oval, slender, long, kidney-shaped, and heart-shaped. Some of the varieties of mangoes are either colored with a shade of red and others yellow while others are green.

Mango ( mangiferia indica ) is one of the most cultivated fruits that originated between northwest Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northwestern India. Numerous cultivars have been developed and spread all over the world including Kenya where it is cultivated in different parts of the country but primarily produced in Ukambani.

Apple mango, Kent mango, Tommy mango, and Ngowe mango are Kenyan mango varieties.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Mangifera indica

Common Name: Swahili (mwembe)

## Uses & Benefits

Mango fruit is not only sweet but also has nutritional value as it helps improve immunity and plays an important role in digestion. Mango fruit is low in calories and is the best choice when reducing calorie intake. Mangoes have mostly consumed as a fruit known as mangoes which are highly rich in vitamins A, C, and D.

They are versatile fruits enjoyed fresh, in smoothies, salads, and desserts, and are also used in salsas, chutneys, and curries. The by products can also serve as animal feed or compost, making mangoes beneficial in both culinary and agricultural contexts.

## Varieties

The first variety of mangoes was seen in India over 4000 years ago and then spread all over the world. Mango is now consumed all over the world more than any other fruit. Over 500 varieties of mangoes are known for different shapes, colors, lengths, and sizes. Green and yellow mangoes are the most common varieties in Kenya.

Polyembryonic cultivars are generated from seed obtained from a tree plant. It includes local cultivars such as "Dodo", "Ngowe", "Boribo", "Sabre", "Peach", and "Batawi".

Cultivar seeds can produce up to five nucellar embryos that are genetically identical to the parent tree.

Plants like "Tommy Atkins," "Kent," "Haden," and "Van Dyke" can only be propagated vegetatively. There are numerous advantages to vegetative propagation, such as early bearing, smaller trees, and so on. It should be encouraged as a result of this.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Mango requires a loamy, alluvial, well-drained, aerated, and deep soil which is well drained to hold its extensive roots. When the tree is growing irrigation is highly encouraged to widen its scope for intercropping. Irrigation is stopped when the tree is big to produce fruits. The correct temperature for growing mangoes is 24c-30c during the growing period with rainfall of 890-1,015 mm is considered ideal for mango growing.

### Growing from Seed

Mango can be propagated either vegetatively or by seed. Its important for farmers to know that not all cultivars propagated by seed will produce seedlings that are same to their parent tree.

Plant propagation has got two distinct groups; polyembroic cultivars, and husbandry.

It is best to use fresh, healthy mango seeds from mature, well-grown trees. They need to be washed and dried in the shade for a few days before being planted. Sow them at a 15 x 30 cm spacing and 5 cm depth. Place them on their sides, with the most prominently curved edge facing up, to form a straight stem.

To hasten germination, the hard husk can be removed before sowing. Seedlings are best grown in a half-shade nursery.

Seeds germinate in 1 to 2 weeks and are transplanted into containers as soon as the first flush of growth hardens (about 4 weeks later and about 10 cm high) (about 18 x 24 cm).

When they reach pencil-thickness, which is approximately 20 cm above soil level, they are ready for grafting. Cleft graft with improved cultivar scion. Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) (Mtwapa, Thika, Embu), prison farms, or any farm with the desired cultivars are good sources of scions of improved cultivars. Water frequently and shade the grafted plants. At about 4 months after grafting, grafted seedlings will be ready for transplanting.

Choose the location of the orchard with care. It is recommended that the soil be deeply cultivated by ploughing. All trees, bushes, and weeds are to be removed from the field before transplanting. Transplanting is ideal during the start of the rainy season. The planting hole should be 60 x 60 cm in size and 100 cm in depth. The hole should be larger (about 90 mm) in dry condition.

Depending on the variety and growth habit of the mango variety chosen, the spacing between trees ranges from 9 x 9 to 14 x 14 m. Before returning the soil to the hole with the young plant, mix in at least two buckets of good compost and a handful of Mijingu rock phosphate before returning the soil to the hole with the young mango plant. Consolidate the soil around the plant. Mulch and water thoroughly. Irrigation should be limited to the first year of the young trees.

### General Care and Maintenance

In the area directly beneath the tree canopy, weeds should be kept to a minimum. During the first five years, intercropping with annual crops is recommended to maximize income until an economical mango yield is achieved. In young plantations, mulching around the tree helps to suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.

Pruning is an essential practice for mango trees; it helps in shaping young trees. Apart from controlling pests, pruning mango trees promotes flowering.

Formative pruning is done on young trees during their first years to help them grow into the desired shape. In the first year, cap the seedling at 1 m in height to produce a spreading framework of branches. In the second year, prune to leave 4 to 5 well-spaced branches as future main branches.

The tree benefits from the natural conditions of sun and wind movement. This reduces relative humidity within the canopy while also creating a less conducive environment for disease development.

Following fruit harvest, structural pruning should be performed, with the canopy at least one meter above the ground. Remove any dead or sucker branches that have grown from the main structural branches, and prune the canopy to allow sunlight to pass through the canopy and reach the ground beneath the tree.

### Harvesting

Flowering usually begins after a dormant period caused by cool or dry weather. Smoke is commonly used by smallholder mango farmers to induce flowering.

A mango plantation will begin producing commercially marketable fruit from four to five years after planting and will be in good production after eight years, reaching full maturity at around 20 years of age.

A single tree should produce 200 to 500 fruits per year, with some varieties, such as "Dodo" and "Boribo," producing up to 1000 fruits per year. Most varieties produce biennially, and a poor harvest may follow a good one. Varieties with an annual bearing tendency should be selected.

Harvest mango fruit when it has reached the mature-green stage when it is hard and green. The "cheeks" of mature fruit are well-developed.

Fruit should be picked by hand. Clip them off with a long stalk of about 2 to 3 cm and pack the fruit in a single layer in the box or crate with the stalks facing downwards.

The latex that drips from the stalk must fall onto an absorbent material (for example tissue paper placed at the bottom of the container).

Although mature mangoes ripen quickly, they have a low tolerance for temperatures below 10°C, especially when picked fresh. Ripe fruits, on the other hand, can be stored at temperatures as low as 7 to 8° C without developing a chilling injury.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Other

#### Algal leaf spot Cephaleuros virescens

- Symptoms: Orange rusty spots on both upper and lower leaf surfaces which may coalesce to form large irregularly shaped patches; scraping away the orange spots reveals a grayish discoloration of the leaf lamina underneath

- Cause: Alga

- Comments: Disease affects many fruit trees in the tropics; infection is unsightly but often harmless

- Management: Management Ensure that trees are properly pruned and fertilized to promote vigor; remove all weeds from around tree bases; employ a wider tree spacing to increase air circulation around the trees; badly infested trees can be treated with copper containing fungicides

# Marjoram

## Description

Marjoram is the name given to many species of perennial herb belonging to the genus Origanum, including the major species Origanum majorana which is grown for its leaves which are commonly used as a herb in cooking. Marjoram plants can be woody or herbaceous and possess multiple branching stems. The leaves are oval or round and are arranged alternately on the stems. The plants produce small pink, purple or white flowers and small oval, brown fruits and can reach up to 1 m (3.3 ft) in height. Marjoram is perennial and can be grown for 3–4 years but is commonly grown as an annual in northern climates. Marjoram may also be referred to as sweet marjoram and  originated from the eastern part of the Mediterranean in Cyprus and southern Turkey.

## Uses

The leaves of the marjoram plant are used fresh or dried as a herb in cooking. They may also be dried and used to extract essential oil which is used as a flavoring.Basic requirements

Marjoram is a temperate or subtropical plant and should be grown in full sunlight for best results. Marjoram will thrive in dry, rocky conditions which closely mimic their natural habitat. Plants will grow well in a rich, light loam with a pH range between 4.9–8.7. The optimum pH for marjoram is around 6.9. Marjoram is less hardy than its relative oregano and will grow best when the annual temperature does not fall below 15°C.

## Propagation

Marjoram can be propagated from seed, cuttings, layering or by dividing the root. The optimum method of vegetative propagation depends on the size and growth habit of the mother plant.

### Seeds

Seeds should be sown outdoors when the soil has warmed and all danger of frost has passed. Seeds can also be started indoors to produce transplants. Marjoram seeds should be sown indoors 6–8 weeks before planting outside. Sow seeds in a sterile seed starting mix in seed trays or pots 0.2–1.0 cm (0.08–0.4 in) deep and water gently. Ensure the temperature remains between 15.5 and 27°C (60–80°F).  Seeds should germinate in about 5 days at 21°C (70°F). Due to the slow growing nature of the plant, many home growers choose to start with small plants which can be obtained from a nursery or garden center.

### Layering

Sprawling marjoram varieties are easily layered by selecting a branch and covering with soil. A rock can be placed on top to hold the branch securely under the soil. The branch will develop it’s own root system and once established, can be cut from the mother plant and transplanted to a new site.

### Cuttings

Larger, upright plants lend themselves to propagating from cuttings. Cuttings should be taken from approximately 20 cm (8 in) down the stem so that the basal portion of the cutting is hard and woody. The upper 5 cm (2 in) of the cutting can be nipped off to promote branching. Cuttings can be rooted in water, sand or a mixture of sand, peat and perlite.

### Transplanting

Marjoram seedlings can be transplanted to the garden when they are between 6 and 8 weeks old, about 2 weeks after the last frost date. Plants should be spaced approximately 30 cm (12 in) apart, allowing 45 cm (18 in) between rows. Pinching back the growing tip of the plants after transplanting will encourage the growth of new shoots. Marjoram requires more moisture than oregano and soil moisture can be conserved by applying a layer of mulch around the plants.

General care and maintenance

Established marjoram plants are tolerant of drought but cannot tolerate water-logging. Established plants require additional irrigation only in very dry conditions. Marjoram planted outdoors requires minimum fertilization, particularly if planted in sandy or gravelly soils. In contrast, container grown plants require frequent addition of fertilizer. A half strength balanced fertilizer can be applied every two weeks if required. Marjoram plants should be pruned regularly to stimulate new growth. this pruning can simply be a method of harvesting from the plant but in the winter, any dead or damaged wood should be removed from the plant

### Harvesting

Marjoram leaves can begin to be harvested any time after the plants have reached a height of 15–20 cm (6–8 in). Harvest leaves by pinching the leaves from the tips of the stems to encourage the more branching. Leaves should be pinched regularly to keep the plants productive and prevent them from going to seed. the best time to harvest marjoram leaves is just prior to flowering. Waiting or buds to form before harvesting will ensure the maximum essential oil content in the leaves.

# Mint

## Description

Mints belong to the genus  Mentha and comprise approximately 20 species in the plant family Lamiaceae and are growm for their leaves which are widely used as a flavoring. Mint plants are mainly aromatic perennials and they possess erect, branching stems and oblong to ovate or lanceolate leaves arranged in opposing pairs on the stems. The leaves are often covered in tiny hairs and have a serrated margin. Mint plants produce a terminal flower spike and the flowers can be white or purple in color depending on variety. Mint plants are fast growing and can become very invasive. They can reach heights of 60–90 cm and will cpntinue to grow for many years once established. Mint may also be referred to by species and these include, but are not limited to peppermint, spearmint, water mint and Japanese mint.

## Uses

Mint leaves are used fresh or dried to make teas, jams and desserts. Essentila oil can be extracted from the leaves and is used as a flavoring.Basic requirements

Mint is a rapidly growing plant which is very easy to grow. It is best grown in partial shade to full sun and is generally very hardy, tolerating temperatures down to -29°C (-20°F). Care should be taken with variegated varieties which may scorch in full sun. Mint is very fast growing which can lead to it invading gardens quickly unless controlled. The best soils for planting mint are rich and moist with a slightly acidic pH between 6.0 and 7.0.

## Propagation

Mint is readily propagated from seeds, cuttings or by dividing an established plant. Seeds should be planted in the Spring or in the Fall in areas that are free from frost. Seeds should be sown to a depth of 6 mm (0.25 in). Seedling should be thinned after emergence such that the plants are spaced 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 in) apart. Established mint can be easily divided for transplanting by taking some branches along with a portion of root. Many people choose to keep mint in containers or sink the containers into the ground when planting to prevent mint from spreading uncontrollably.

General care and maintenance

Mint is very vigorous and should be pruned regularly to keep the plants in check. Remove any unwanted runners and pinch the tips of the plants back regularly. Mint may be fertilized in the Spring with a slow release fertilizer to supply it with nutrients throughout the growing season. Pinch of any flowers that form to conserve the flavor of the leaves. Essential oil content is reduced during bloom. In areas with mild winters, mint can be moved to a sheltered area of the garden to overwinter, otherwise the plant can be cut to the ground in the Fall. Container grown mint plants can be brought indoors.

### Harvest

Mint leaves can be harvested as soon as the plants have reached 8 to 10 cm (3-4 in) in height. Cut leaves and stems with a sharp knife or scissors. If harvesting whole stems, cut the stem at about 2.5 cm (1 in) from the soil line.

# Molokhia (Mallow)

## Description

Molokhia, Corchorus olitorius, is an herbaceous annual plant in the family Malvaceae grown for its edible leaves which are consumed as a vegetable. The molokhia plant is tall and is either unbranched or possesses few lateral branches. The stems and leaves of the plant can be dark red or dark green or an intermediate color. The leaves are oval and tapering with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers and pods that contain the seeds. Molokhia can grow to a height of 2–4 m (6.5–13 ft) and is an annual, harvested after one growing season. Molokhia may also be referred to as jute, nalta jute, red jute or mallow and likely originates from Africa.

## Uses

The leaves of the plant are usually consumed after cooking as a vegetable. The stems and leaves exude a sticky gum-like substance (mucilage) when cooked, giving it a texture similar to okra. It is commonly incorporated into stews.General requirements

Molokhia typically requires warm, humid conditions to thrive and will grow best in deep, loose soils. It will grow well in sandy or clay loam with a pH between 5 and 8.6. It requires an average monthly rainfall of 75-100 mm. It is reported tolerate average annual temperatures of between 6.8 and 27.5°C (44.2-81.5°F).

## Propagation

# Mulberry

## Description

Mulberry is the name given to several species of deciduous shrub or tree in the genus Morus (family Moraceae) which are grown for their edible fruits. The genus includes white mulberry (Morus alba) and red mulberry (Morus rubra). Mulberries are small to medium sized shrubs or trees with a thick tan-gray ridged trunk and light green leaves which vary in shape depending on variety. Leaves are arranged alternately and are lobed or unlobed, cordate (heart-shaped), dentate (toothed) and acuminate (tapering). The trees produce small green-yellow flowers in dense spikes and an oval aggregate fruit made up of individual drupelets. The fruit can be white, pink or purple to purple-black in color and contains numerous brown seeds. Mulberry can reach a height of 15 m (49 ft) and are quite short lived, with an economic lifespan of around 15 years. Mulberry is believed to originate from China.

## Uses

Mulberries can be eaten fresh or used as fillings for tarts and pies. The fruit may also be used to make jams and jellies. They have been traditionally planted as a food source for silk worms.Basic requirements

Mulberry trees should be grown in sunny locations, preferably in a deep soil. Mulberries are reasonably tolerant of drought, particularly white mulberry and can be grown successfully in poor soil. Mulberry will grow well in a variety of soils but optimum growth will be achieved when planted in a deep well draining loam with a slightly acidic pH of between 5.5 and 6.5. Fruit yields are increased when trees are positioned in full sun. Mulberry trees are cold hardy, although the specific temperature at which they will be damaged varies by variety. Some white mulberries can withstand temperatures of -32°C (-25°F).

## Propagation

Mulberry trees can be propagated from seeds, cuttings or by grafting. Seeds should be collected from ripe fruits and removed by macerating the fruit in a water bath. Seeds which sink to the bottom of the bath are viable and can be planted immediately or dried and cold stored for planting later. Trees grown from seed can take 10 years or more to produce fruit. Cuttings can be taken during regular pruning of the tree. Branches should be 22 to 30 cm (8.6–11.8 in) in length and possess a minimum of three buds. Cuttings should be planted immediately. Grafted plants produce stronger root systems than trees produced by any other method of propagation. Grafting is usually achieved by budding in the Spring.

### Planting

In the case of mulberry bushes, seedling are transplanted when they have reached 10–15 cm (4–6 in) in height. Seedlings for mulberry trees should be allowed to grow larger, usually at least 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and are trained prior to planting. Mulberry trees do not need to cross pollinate but if growing more than one tree they should be spaced 1.6 m (5.2 ft) apart.

General care and maintenance

Although established trees are relatively tolerant of drought, mulberries should be provided with additional irrigation during dry periods. The trees require little fertilization and a single annual application of a balanced fertilizer is usually sufficient to meet the growing requirement of the trees. Once trained, little pruning of the trees is required. Dead and damaged wood should be removed at the end of the growing season.

### Harvesting

Mulberry fruit is usually ready for harvest in late Spring. The fruits are usually harvested by hand either by picking them from the tree directly, or by shaking the branches.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Armillaria root rot Armillaria mellea

- Symptoms: Small, discolored leaves which drop from tree prematurely; death of branches; death of entire tree; may be small mushrooms growing in clusters at base of tree

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Fungus survives in dead and decaying wood of infested tree stumps; disease spreads when mycelium colonizes roots of tree

- Management: Management Control of Armillaria root rot once present is extremely difficult; great care should be taken to only plant disease-free planting material; trees should not be planted in recently cleared areas known to have been infested with Armillaria previously; diseased trees, including stumps, should be dug up and removed from orchards; avoid stressing trees by providing adequate irrigation, fertilization and insect control; applications of fungicides is not recommended on infected trees; trees may die within one to several years depending on the severity of the infection

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial blight Pseudomonas syringae

- Symptoms: Small black, angular spots in leaves; large brown spots on leaves, flowers and/or fruits

- Cause: Bacteria

- Comments: Disease emergence favored by poor air circulation around branches and wet foliage

- Management: Management Branches exhibiting dieback and severe blighting should be pruned out of the canopy; avoid overhead irrigation; if cankers appear on the trunk of the tree then it is likely it will die and it should be removed


# Mushrooms

## Description

Mushrooms are the fleshy fruiting bodies of fungi and include edible species in the genus Agaricus (button mushrooms, portabellas and criminis), Pleurotus (oyster mushrooms), and Volvariella, (straw mushrooms). Mushrooms are highly variable in appearance depending on their stage of development and variety. Agaricus mushrooms have a cap and stem, the cap is a pale grey or brown in color and is rounder while immature, but flattens out as it reaches maturity and can reach a diameter of 5–10 cm (2–4 in). Pleurotus mushrooms may not have a stem and instead may be laterally attached to a growing substrate such as the bark of a a tree. Pleurotus mushrooms are smooth and elongated and can reach 4–15 cm (1.5–6.0 in) in diameter. Volvariella mushrooms are small, with pink gills and a characteristic sac-like covering (volva) at the base of the stem. The cap can reach 5–15 cm (2–6 in) in diameter.

## Uses

Mushrooms are widely used after cooking and are incorporated into many dishes worldwide.Basic requirements

Mushrooms grow from a filamentous mass (mycelia or 'spawn') that grows on dead or decaying plant material. Agaricus mushrooms can be cultivated in a dark, moist, cool space such as a basement.  Agaricus mushrooms require a rich organic material in which to grow such as horse manure. Oyster mushrooms are cultivated on hardwood logs by introducing spawn into pre-drilled holes in the wood or or by sawing a section through the log and covering the exposed wood in spawn before nailing the log back together. The logs are then stored in watertight bags containing sand and soaked with water. Oyster mushrooms can also be grown in straw or sawdust by inoculating the sterile substrate with spawn and sealing in plastic bags. Straw mushrooms can be grown on wheat straw, rice straw or sawdust inoculated with spawn and stored at temperatures between 28 and 36°C and relative humidity of 75–85%.

Propagating Agaricus mushrooms

### Substrate

Substrates for growing Agaricus mushrooms are either agricultural by-products such as straw bedded horse manure or synthetic composts specially formulated for mushroom growing. Horse manure substrates should have a nitrogen content of 1.5–1.7%, while synthetic composts should contain between 1.7 and 1.9%. Additional nitrogen can be added to the substrate if required using nitrogen supplements or through the addition of poultry manure. Gypsum is commonly added to the mix to buffer the pH and to give the compost the desired structure for optimum mushroom growth. The growing substrate then must be composted to make it suitable for growing mushrooms. Horse manure is composted by turning every 4–5 days and watering after each turning to keep the substrate moist. The compost is ready to use when it turns a rich brown color, usually after 4 or 5 turnings. Other compost mixes should be turned after 5–6 days and kept moist by watering. The compost should be turned a second time and should be ready for use after another week. the compost is then set out in trays for planting the spawn. In commercial mushroom production, the compost is pasteurized to remove and fungal, bacterial or insect contaminants from the medium before the spawn is planted.

### Spawn

Mushroom spawn can be purchased from many commercial seed companies or online suppliers. Spawn should be planted when the compost reaches 24°C (75°F) and should be planted in the trays at a depth of 5 cm (2 in) allowing 20–25 cm (8–10 in) between plantings. The temperature should be kept at 21°C (70°F) for the next 21 days before lowering to 15.6°C (60°F) and covering with a 2.5 cm (1 in) layer of good quality soil.  The growing mushrooms should be kept moist throughout by watering with a gentle spray of water whenever the top of the soil begins to dry. Tiny white spots should begin to appear on the soil surface after approximately 3 weeks and will begin to be ready for harvest approximately 10 days later.

### Harvesting

Harvest the mushrooms at soil level by carefully twisting them or by cutting them at soil level with  sharp knife. Pulling can damage other surrounding mushrooms. Harvest flushes of mushrooms daily. The beds will continue to produce for up to 6 months.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

- Symptoms: Small spotting on mushrooms; mushrooms deformed; surface of mushroom gray and fuzzy; localized dead areas on cap; pinched areas on cap; fruiting body may no longer be recognisable as a mushroom; severe infection can cause a deformation known as "dry bubble" which causes the sporocarp to appear as large puffball like masses; bubbles will become covered with a gray, fuzzy growth

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: May be confused with bacterial infections; spread by flies and/or infected equipment

- Management: Management Bubbles should not be disturbed by touching and can be destroyed using salt; salt should be placed in a plastic cup and then placed over the bubbles to dry them out and provide a barrier to prevent spores spreading; fungicides are available for the treatment of Verticullium diseases of mushrooms but many have toxic effects on the mushrooms as they are themselves a fungus


# Mustard

## Description

Mustards, (Brassica spp.) are herbaceous annual plants in the family Brassicaceae grown for their seeds which are used as a spice. Mustard plants are thin herbaceous herbs with yellow flowers. The leaves of the plant are toothed, lobed, and occasionally have the larger terminal lobes. Plants can reach 16 cm (6.3 in) in length. The yellow flowers grow in spike like clusters of 2–12 flowers and individual flowers are 8 mm (0.3 in) in diameter. The seeds are red to brown in color and produced from each flower. Mustard can grow 1.2-2 m (4–6.6 ft) in height and as an annual plant, survives only one growing season. Mustard may also be referred to as mustard, brown mustard, red mustard, yellow mustard or wedlock and is believed to have originated in the temperate regions of Europe.

## Uses

The leaves and shoots of the mustard plant are consumed as a vegetable in some countries. Mustard seed is incorporated into seasonings and dressings. Mustard may be grown as a cover crop in rotation with other vegetables.Basic requirements

Mustard grows very well in cool climates with short growing seasons, at temperatures as low as 4.4°C (40°F). Seedlings can tolerate some light frost but severe frost will kill the plants. The mustard plant can be grown in sandy, loamy or clay soils with a pH between 4.9 and 8.2 and prefers moist soil. The plant will tolerate partial shade.

## Propagation

Mustards is propagated from seed and due to the small size of the seeds, should be planted in a well prepared seed bed which is firm and flat. Mustard seeds should be sown in Spring once soils have warmed to 4.4–7.2°C (40–45°F) and should be planted at a depth of 1.25–2.5 cm (0.5–1.0 in) at a density of 8–14 lbs of seeds per acre. The seed can be spread by broadcasting in the home garden or, in the case of commercial production, using a seed drill. Mustard generally matures in 80–85 days.

General care and maintenance

Weeds can cause huge losses in mustard cultivation as they quickly out compete seedlings and are difficult to eradicate once established. The best method of preventing weed growth in a mustard field is to plant seeds at the appropriate depth. Shallow planted seeds germinate rapidly, allowing the development of a uniform plant stand. Established plants are less susceptible to competition from weeds. soil should be tested to determine nutrient requirements prior to planting. Mustard will benefit from the addition of supplemental nitrogen and this is generally applied at a rate of 100–120 lb per acre.

### Harvesting

Mustard is generally ready to harvest 80 to 85 days after planting. The crop should be harvested promptly to reduce losses to shattering. In commercially grown fields the recommended method of harvest is swathing. The plants should be cut just below the height of the lowest seed pods. In the home garden, mustard can be harvested by hand by cutting the plants. The seeds can then be recovered from the pods and dried for storage.

# Napier grass

## Description

Napier grass is one of the important perennial tropical forage crop belong to family Poaceae. It is also called Uganda grass or  elephant grass. It is native to  Africa but is now grown in many tropical countries. It is C4 plant and can grow well in marginal land.  The grass grows tall and forms large clumps like bamboo.

## Uses

Mainly used as fodder crop. Generally it is fed directly to cattle or made into silage or hay. It produces huge biomass and can be harvested multiple times in a year which making it a good raw materials for biofuel production. Napier grass is planted in marginal lands and slopes to increase soil fertility and to reduce soil erosion. It is also the main source for paper production in mnay regions.

Napier grass is also used in integrated pest management strategy as pull crop mainly in maize and sorghum producing areas. Napier grass is grown along maize or sorghum (in rows or in borders) to reduce the stem borer population.

It is also commonly grown in borders of many crops as windbreak and firebreak.Basic requirements

Napier grass is best grown in warm, tropical and subtropical regions. And grows well up to an altitude of 2000 m from sea level. Generally it perform very well at temperature ranging from 25 to 40 degree celsius. Napier grass is very sensitive to frost and water logging conditions.

### Planting

Napier grass usually produces few full form seeds. So the main mode of propagation is by stem cuttings. The cuttings with five internodes are planted by inserting into furrows at 75 cm apart, both along and between the rows.

## Common Pests and Diseases

- Symptoms: Infected plants show thinner, shorter stems and produce few small size leaves. The shoot become hard and flowers prematurely. Head turns into smut.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: The estimated yield loss due to smut disease ranges from 26 to 46%. Disease mainly spreads through wind and plant materials. Head smut was reported first in 1910 from Napier grass specimen collected from Cameroon. Later the disease reported from other countries like Uganda (1930), Rwanda (1963), Tanzania (1975), Kenya (1980) and Congo. The disease need more attention since there is risk of spreading to other African countries.

- Management: Management Grow resistant varieties where available. Use disease-free planting materials. Keep the plants healthy by providing proper nutrients. Avoid using manure from livestocks that have been previously fed with smut infected plants.

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Napier Grass Stunt Disease (NGSD) Candidatus Phytoplasma oryzae (Ns- phytoplasma)

- Symptoms: The infected plants typically have small yellow leaves and short internodes. It produce large number of tillers. Plant become stunted and eventually die.

- Cause: Phytoplasma

- Comments: The disease reduces forage yield by 40 to 90%. The disease is mainly transmitted by plant and leaf hoppers and stem cuttings.

- Management: Management Use disease free healthy planting materials. Remove and destroy the infected plants. Follow crop rotation.


# Nutmeg

## Description

Nutmeg, Myristica fragrans, is a tropical evergreen tree in the family Myristicaceae grown for its seeds which are used as spices. The nutmeg tree has natural conical shape with a grey-brown trunk and dark green glossy leaves. The branches of the tree spread in whorls and the leaves are oval or lanceolate in shape. Leaves are arranged alternately on the branches and are 5–15 cm (2–6 in) in length, smooth and lighter in color on the under side. The tree produces a clusters of numerous male flowers whereas the female flowers are produced solitary or in a maximum cluster of 3. The flowers are pale yellow and fragrant. The fruit of the nutmeg tree is a rounded fleshy berry which splits into two halves when it ripens. The seed inside is shiny dark brown and oval in shape. The seed coat is covered by lacy red aril which is attached at the base of the seed. Nutmeg trees can reach a height of 20 m (66 ft) and may live for upwards of 80 years. Nutmeg may also be referred to as mace and it is not known in a wild state. It likely originated from the Moluccan Islands, particularly the volcanic island of Banda.

## Uses

The seed of the nutmeg berry (nutmeg) and the aril (mace) are dried and used whole or ground as culinary spices.Basic requirements

Nutmeg is a tropical plant and requires dry periods to flower. It will grow best at temperatures between 20 and 30°C (68–86°F) and can tolerate a range of soils provided that the are well draining. Trees will grow optimally in a deep loamy sand rich in organic matter with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. The trees love heat but should be protected from strong afternoon sun and also require some shelter from wind.

## Propagation

### Seeds

### Marcotting

Nutmeg trees can also be grown from marcotted material. Vigorous branches are selected from female trees. The branches should be 1.2–1.5 cm in diameter. The branch is then split longitudinally in an area that is approximately 90 cm (35 in) from the end of the branch. Each split should be approximately 5 cm (2 in) in length. A bamboo splint is positioned along the area of the split to secure the branch and prevent it from breaking. A small piece of the split branch is then removed on the bottom side of the branch. This piece is approximately 6–12 mm (02–0.4 in) long. The remainder of the split is held open by placing a piece of hardwood to act as a wedge. Finally, the exposed piece of branch is dusted with rooting powder and wrapped in moistened peat moss, coconut coir or similar and sealed in polyethylene sheeting. Marcotted branches usually develop roots in 4–12 months. once an adequate root system has developed, the branches are severed from the tree and potted.

### Planting

### Harvesting

Fruits are harvested when they are open by using a blade attached to the end of a long pole. A basket is also attached to the end of the pole such that when the fruit is cut from the tree with the blade, it drops into the basket. Seeds may also be collected from the ground after they have dropped from the tree but this encourages crop losses through disease.

# Oats

## Description

Oats are annual grasses belonging to the genus Avena, in the family Poaceae and are grown primarily for use as livestock feed. Several species of oats are grown commercially in different regions of the world, including Avena sativa (common oat), Avena byzantina (Algerian or red oat), Avena nuda (naked oat) and Avena sterilis (the sterile or animated oat). Like wheat, oats generally have been developed into different varieties that are adapted to planting at different times of the year. Spring oats are planted for a late summer harvest, whereas Winter oats are planted for harvesting in early to mid summer. Overwintering varieties are more commonly grown in regions with mild winters. Oats generally possess an upright stem and fibrous root system.  The inflorescence consists of a number of branches, or racemes, and spikelets (20–150 per plant) which usually contain three florets or flowers (naked oats produce 3–7 flowers per spikelet).  Generally, two seeds (kernels) are produced per spikelet, but sometimes only one develops. Ancestors of the common oat, Avena sativa and the closely related Avena byzantina originated from the Fertile Crescent of the Near East.

## Uses

Oats can be rolled or crushed to produce oatmeal or ground to produce oat flour. Oats may also be used in the production of several baked goods such as oat cakes or oat bread. The vast majority of commercially grown oats are used as livestock feed.Basic requirements

Oats grow best in cool, moist climates, with the optimum temperature for growth being between 20 and 21°C (68–70°F). The plants will thrive in well drained soils but are adapted to grow in many soil types, requiring a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. Oats are less tolerant of drought and heat than other cereals but, like other small grains, tolerate acidic soils well.

## Propagation

Oats are propagated from seed which can be sown in Spring or in Fall depending on the variety, prevailing climate and the intended use. Commercially produced oats are drilled into a prepared seedbed. Seedbeds should be firm and free of any weeds or vegetation. If oats are being grown to harvest grain then the recommended seeding rate is 60–90 lb of seed per acre. This should be increased slightly if the seeds is being sown by broadcasting as is commonly the case in small-scale production or home gardens.  Seeds should be sown at depths of 3–7 cm (1.2–2.8 in) allowing 15–17 cm (5.9–6.7 in) between rows.

General care and maintenance

Soil should be tested prior to planting oats in order to establish the rate of fertilizer and lime application required. Lime is often applied to raise the pH of the soil. if pH is too low, yields may be reduced. Nitrogen should be applied to oats after seedlings emerge at a rate of 20 lb per acre. Further applications are made throughout the growing season based on the specific soil and rotation schedule. In addition to nitrogen, oats require phosphorus and potassium for optimal growth. The rates of application of these nutrients should be based on the results of a soil test.

### Harvesting

Oats are ready to harvest when the kernels are at the “hard dough” stage when the grain moisture content drops below 14%. The plants will have lost their green color and appear yellow-brown. The kernels harden and cannot be dented with a fingernail. Commercially produced oats are harvested by combine. Small-scale productions can be harvested by hand cutting. After harvest, the grain must be dried before being stored.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose Colletotrichum graminicola

- Symptoms: Red to brown oval lesions on the leaves; black fungal structures may visible on lesions; crowns become bleached and then turn brown; plants are more susceptible to lodging

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus survives as spores on seeds and crop debris; spores can be spread by wind or splashing water; nutrient deficient plants are more susceptible to the disease

- Management: Management Provide plants with adequate levels of fertilizer; rotate crops to improve soil quality; control weeds in field; turn crop debris into soil after harvest to limit release of spores; avoid planting oats in soils with a high pH`

#### Crown rust Puccinia coronata

- Management: Management Control of the disease can be difficult; crop rotation to a non- host is recommended for at least one year; applications of appropriate fungicides if available can help to control the disease in conjunction with the other measures detailed here


# Oil palm

## Description

Oil palm, includes the palm species native to Africa, Elaeis guineensis, and the species native to South and Central America, Elaeis oleifera. Both species are perennial tropical trees in the family Arecaceae which are grown for their oil which is used in cooking and in industry. Oil palm trees are unbranched with a long stout single stem, or trunk, terminating in a crown of 7–100 leaves. The leaves are pinnate and can reach 3–5 m (9.8–16.4 ft) in length. The tree produces large, spherical red fruits in bunches. Up to 200 fruits can be produced per bunch and and the oil is extracted from the pulp and kernel. Oil palm can reach heights of 20–30 m (65.6–98.4 ft) and has an economic lifespan of 25–30 years, at which point they become too tall to be managed efficiently and are cut down. Left alone, oil palm has been known to live for periods up to 200 years. Oil palm may also be referred to as African oil palm and originated from West Africa.

## Uses

Palm oil is widely used as a cooking oil, as an ingredient in many processed foods and as a substitute for butter. Palm oil can be used to produce biodiesel. Palm oil is also used as a binding agent in cosmetics.Basic requirements

Oil palm is typically grown in tropical lowland regions over large areas. The tree requires deep soil and stable high temperatures (30–32°C/86–89.6°F for at least 80 days) for optimum productivity. Temperatures below 20°C (68°F) will severely reduce the growth of both species, while the African oil palm will also suffer a reduction in growth at temperatures above 40°C (104°F). Palms will grow in a variety of deep tropical soils and will tolerate a pH between 4.0 and 8.0. Oil palms have a requirement for continuous moisture throughout the year. The trees can tolerate 2–3 months of dry conditions but it can affect yields.

## Propagation

Trees are propagated from seed and are germinated prior to planting by moistening them and and placing them in a small box within a polyethylene bag placed in a germinator. Once the seeds have germinated they are allowed to grow further in a pre-nursery (a prepared bed, tray or container with fertile soil). The seedlings are then planted on into a nursery where they will be allowed to grow for a further 6–12 months before they are planted in the field. Field seedlings are planted in the field allowing 9 m (29.5 ft) between trees and an additional 9 m (29.5 ft) between rows. Trees will begin to bear fruit after 3–4 years.

General care and maintenance

Oil palms are frequently planted along with a leguminous cover crop which helps provide nitrogen to the palms while also suppressing weeds. When bunches are harvested, it is usual for fronds to be pruned. The number of fronds per palm is maintained at between 35 and 40. Oil palm plantations are rarely, if ever, irrigated. Due to the moisture requirements of the palms, supplemental irrigation is recommended during dry spells.

### Harvesting

Harvesting of oil palms generally begins 2.5 years after the trees are planted in the field. Harvesting takes place throughout the year, usually at 2–3 week intervals, as the bunches ripen. Bunches are harvested by cutting from the tree using a sharp knife or sickle.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial bud rot Erwinia spp.

- Symptoms: Parts of spear leaf petiole or rachi turning brown; discoloration may be associated with a wet rot; spear leaf may be wilted and/or chlorotic; leaves may be collapsing and hanging from the crown; infection of the bud results in buds becoming rotten and putrid, leading to death of the palm

- Cause: Bacteria

- Comments: Disease occurs in oil palm in Colombia, Costa Rica, Democratic republic of Congo, Ecuador, Nicarauga, Nigeria, Panama and Southeast Asia

- Management: Management Plant oil palm varieties with resistance to the bacteria; rotting tissue on spear leaves should be removed to prevent bacteria spreading to buds; palm buds can be protected using copper-based fungicides

### Disease Category: Fungal

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Serious disease in Far East

- Management: Management There are currently no fungicides recommended for protecting palms from Ganoderma butt rot; palms should be monitored closely for signs of disease, especially if a palm has died or been removed nearby as fungi can colonize old stumps and release spores; infected trees should be removed as once symptoms are present in foliage, a large portion of the trunk is already rotted and the palm is unstable; do not replant palm in soil where an infected palm has been removed

#### Oil palm wilt Fusarium oxysporum

- Symptoms: Symptoms of the disease vary with age of host; disease can affect seedlings and mature trees; seedlings exhibit retarded growth, reduced leaf size, chlorosis of older leaves and tip necrosis; field palms may exhibit a bright yellow chlorosis of leaves in the mid-canopy which starts at the tip pf the pinnae and moves towards petioles before affecting adjacent fronds and spreading to older leaves in the canopy; in older palms, lower leaves wilt and dry out and fronds break close to the base of the trunk; new fronds are chlorotic and stunted; the palm shows decline on one side and develops symptoms in the lower canopy; infection spreads rapidly upwards and infects the bud, killing the palm

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus infests palms through the root system

- Management: Management International quarantine procedures have limited the spread of the disease between major palm oil producing countries; dead or dying trees should be felled and burned to prevent spread in plantations; if palms are replanted then new palm should be planted a distance of 3.9 m from infested stump; soil within a 3 m radius of infested stumps should be treated with dazomet and covered for a period of 30 days

#### Pestalotiopsis leaf spot Pestalotiopsis spp.

- Symptoms: Tiny black spots on leaves which enlarge into 2 mm long elliptical, elongated lesions; lesions may expand and be surrounded by black tissue and chlorosis between lesions; lesions may be present on leaf petioles and rachis

- Comments: Disease has been reported worldwide

- Management: Management If palm is severely diseased, it should be removed from plantation and destroyed; palms should be planted with adequate spacing to allow air to circulate between trees; remove weeds from around palms; applications appropriate broad spectrum foliar fungicides can help to protect the palms from disease


# Okra

## Description

Okra, also known as lady's fingers, is mainly grown for its young immature pods, which are consumed as a vegetable, raw, cooked, or fried. It is a common ingredient in soups and sauces. The pods can be conserved by drying or pickling. The leaves are sometimes used as spinach or cattle feed, the fibers from the stem for cord, the plant mucilage (thick gluey substance) for medical and industrial purposes, and the seeds as a substitute for coffee. Okra seeds contain a considerable amount of good-quality oil and protein.

Okra plants have small erect stems that can be bristly or hairless with heart- shaped leaves. The leaves are 10–20 cm (4–8 in) long with 5–7 lobes The plant produces flowers with five white to yellow petals which are 4–8 cm (1.6–3.1 in) in diameter. The seed pod is a capsule up to 25 cm (10 in) long, containing numerous seeds. Okra can grow 1.2–1.8 m (4–6 ft) tall and as an annual plant, survives only one growing season.

It is believed to have originated in Ethiopia but is also particularly popular in India, West Africa, and Brazil.

### Crop Details

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Okra is grown at elevations ranging from sea level to 1600 m. The optimum temperatures for the growth and production of high-quality pods range between 24 and 30°C. The crop is sensitive to frost and temperatures below 12°C.

Okra will grow on a wide range of soils, but it prefers soils high in organic matter. The seeds perform well on fertile, well-drained loamy soil. When the soil fertility level is low, organic manure, fertilizer, or compost can be applied to improve soil productivity. it must be frequently fertilized in sandy soils, as soluble nutrients readily leach from the root zone. Its optimum range of soil pH is between 5.8 and 6.5. A soil test will indicate if lime is required to adjust the pH and the amount to apply. If lime is recommended, dolomite should be used and applied 3 to 4 months before the crop is seeded. Okra is sensitive to salinity. Okra can grow in a wide range of rainfall regimes but needs 400 mm of water for the growing period of about 3 months.

### Growing from Seed

Thorough soil preparation 2 to 3 months before planting is recommended to allow crop residues and organic matter in the soil to decompose before okra is planted. Early land preparation also permits weed seeds to germinate and allows early cultivation to destroy young weeds before planting.

The crop produces reasonably well on most soil types, although a fertile loam is preferable. Cultivars that are susceptible to root-knot eelworm (Meloidogyne incognita) do not produce a satisfactory crop on infected light or sandy soils. This species tolerates soils that are slightly acidic and will grow successfully in soils with a pH of 6.0-6.8.

Okra plants may be established by direct seeding in the field, by growing seedlings in nursery seedbeds, or by raising seedlings in plastic trays. Before planting, it is advisable to soak the okra seeds in water for 24 hours, to break seed dormancy and speed up the germination rate or reduce germination days. In Kenya, okra is sown directly in the field. About 8 to 10 kg of seed is required per hectare. The planting depth is about 1.5 cm.

Spacing varies from 45 x 45 cm, 50 x 30 cm, or 60 x 15 cm between the rows and within the rows, respectively. In some parts of Kenya, okra is planted 2 x 2 m in flood irrigation basins. Spacing of about 1 to 2 feet intra-row and 3 to 4 feet inter-row should be used. The main export season in Kenya is October to May; hence planting should start in July to target this export season. However, with irrigation okra can be grown all year round for the local and off-season export markets.

### General Care and Maintenance

Before planting, manure or artificial fertilizer has to be mixed well into the top 10 cm of the soil. The uptake of minerals is rather high. When the crop yields 10 t of fresh fruits per hectare, the uptake is 100 kg N, 10 kg P, 60 kg K, 80 kg Ca, and 40 kg Mg. Fertilizer can be given in three split applications, at sowing, after 3 weeks, and again at 6 weeks after sowing.

The general recommendation in Kenya (issued by Horticultural Crops Development Authority) for conventional production (non-organic production) is as follows: well-composted manure should be applied at planting at the rate of 15 to 20 t/ha (17 to 20 gm/plant). It should be mixed thoroughly with the soil in the planting hole.

Okra is harvested over a long period and weed control is important throughout the cropping season. Smallholder growers in Kenya control weeds by hand hoeing.

Okra should be rotated with baby corn, maize, peas, onions, potatoes, fodder grass, or small grains. Being in the same family as cotton it shares the same complex of pests and diseases therefore okra should not be grown before or after cotton.

Okra is a heavily foliaged crop, so its water requirements are high. According to the Kenya Ministry of Agriculture, okra needs 400 mm of water during the growing season of three months. A general guideline for semi-arid areas, where okra is mostly grown in Kenya, is to provide about 35 mm of water per week (this equals 35 liters of water per square meter). Critical times for irrigating okra are at emergence and from flowering to pod production. Saline or chlorinated water should not be used for irrigation.

### Harvesting

Early-maturing cultivars give the first harvest 7 weeks after sowing. A developing fruit should be harvested 7-8 days after flowering. Earlier picking depresses yields because of suboptimal fruit weight. Delayed picking depresses marketable yields because over-aged fruits become fibrous. Therefore, okra fields are harvested at intervals of 2-3 days. For seed production, the whole crop can be harvested at once. As the plant continues to flower, fruits can be picked every 2 days. Picking fruits is usually done manually. Intensive contact with slightly hairy fruits and plants may lead to skin irritation.

Most varieties grown in Kenya are ready to pick 45 to 55 days after planting. Pods are ready for harvesting about 4 to 6 days after flowering. Pods are harvested when still tender and on attaining a length of 7 to 15 cm, depending on variety and market requirements.

Regular picking every 1 to 2 days is essential to ensure pods are within the size prescribed by the market. Okra should not be harvested when it is raining or excessively wet. Excess moisture can induce mold development on the pods and the cut petioles. Okra pods decay quickly; therefore they should be harvested within a day to market.

Harvesting is done by hand. The pods can be snapped off or cut off, leaving a small stalk not longer than one cm. The pods must be handled carefully otherwise they may be bruised and may discolor. It is best to pick pods into a waist bag to reduce skin damage and to avoid excessive bending of the pods. Wearing rubber gloves when harvesting and handling pods is recommended. This will protect the skin from irritating sap produced by the okra plant.

After harvesting, the fruits can be stored for only 3-5 days at about 10°C; lower temperatures may cause damage to the fruits. Okra should not be washed until shortly before use as washing makes the fruit slimy.

Fresh okra can quite easily be transported in bulk and kept for several days without much loss of quality. Dried okra is an important product in West Africa. Some countries have a small canning and freezing industry.

# Onion

## Description.

Being a biennial vegetable onion is grown as an annual in temperate zones. The varieties that thrive in the tropics are effectively annuals because they can produce seed within the first year of growth.

The plant's stem is a flattened disc with tubular leaves that form a pseudo stem where their sheaths overlap. There are 3-8 leaves per plant that are either erect or oblique. The plant produces p ink or white flowers cluster on its stalks. The bulbs are formed just above the flattened stem of the plant by overlapping leaves.

Onions may also be referred to as cultivars and these include red or purple onions, shallots, and spring onions or scallions. They are particularly suited to smallholder farming in most countries.

In the tropics onions can be grown year-round where irrigation is possible.

The bulb is made up of layers, each of which corresponds to a leaf. They are generally oval, but their shape can vary, and they appear in clusters of 3-18 per plant. It is shielded by a membrane that transforms into a paper coat. Onion plants can grow to a height of 50 cm (20 in) and are grown as annuals, harvested after one growing season; however, in the tropics, onions can be grown year-round if irrigation is available.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Allium cepa

Common Name: Kitunguu, (Swahili), Gitunguru (Kikuyu) Kitunguru (Maragoli).

## Uses & Benefits

The bulb is an edible vegetable and is the most commonly used part of the onion, usually consumed after cooking although it can be eaten fresh. The stems and leaves are also edible. In general, onions are used for salads (bunching onions or sliced full-grown bulbs), pickling (e.g. silver skin onions), cooking (such as in soups), and frying (for example, with meat). It also plays an important role in traditional medicine (e.g. as a diuretic).

## Varieties

Red Creole: This is a popular standard variety in high demand because of its good keeping quality. It produces mainly single onions from transplants, red, flat-round, and with a pungent taste.

Red Tropicana: Red bulbing type

Red Tropicana F1 Hybrid: Produces large, red, thick flat onions with firm pungent flesh. It is highly productive and therefore demands high levels of management. It keeps well in a dry aerated store.

Bombay Red: It is a variety of dry and warmer conditions. It is small to medium-sized, globe-shaped, purplish red, and pungent.

Yellow Granex FI Hybrid: This is an early maturing high yielding attractive, thick flat onion with thin yellow scales. The flesh is medium firm, crisp, and mild in flavor. The shape and size are uniform leading to higher market prices, and the storage quality is good.

Texas early Grano: This is a fresh market, early maturing variety (100 - 120 days) with a rather short shelf life. It is yellowish, mild, and not very pungent. The bulbs are high-top shaped with dry yellow scales. It is a heavy yielder for high-altitude regions. Ideal for fish salads.

White Creole: This is a white variety normally used for dehydration.

Green bunching: non-bulbing spring onion. It has attractive tasty dark green leaves. It is an early and highly productive onion grown for stems rather than bulbs. It is tolerant to sun scotch and it is recommended for salads and fresh markets.

In Tanzania, Red Bombay is the most popular onion variety. Its production is highest in March, May, and December and is predominantly sourced from Mang’ola.

Other popular varieties grown in the East Africa region include Red Pinoy F1, Red Creole, Bombay Red, and Texas Early Grano.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

In temperate zones, onion is a cool-season biennial and is tolerant to frost. They produce bulbs with growing day lengths. Optimum temperatures for plant development are between 13 and 24°C, although the range for seedling growth is narrow, between 20 and 25°C. High temperatures favor bulbing and curing. In the tropics, only short-day or day-neutral onion varieties will form bulbs. These thrive in warm to hot climates of 15-30°C. If the temperature greatly exceeds that required for bulbing, maturity is hastened and bulbs do not grow to maximum size, consequently lowering the yields.

Onions can be grown on any fertile, well-drained, non-crusting soil. The optimum pH range is 6.0 to 6.8, although alkaline soils are also suitable. Onions do not grow well in soils below pH 6.0. On light sandy soils, irrigation is necessary. Irrigation could be either overhead or on a drip. Onions at the bulbing stage need a substantial amount of water, but excessive moisture must be avoided during the growing season. Avoid the application of fresh manure to the crop, as this will cause the plants to develop thick necks and too many leaves at the expense of bulb formation.

### Growing from Seed

A grower must consider several factors when planting onions, among them are onion varieties. Onions can be planted in three different ways: by sets transplants or direct seeding. Sets are grown from seeds, producing small bulbs before going dormant.

Planting sets and transplants can be advantageous because they are ready to harvest one to two months earlier than onions planted directly. Planting in sets and transplanting is much more expensive than direct seeding.

Harvests can be completed earlier in the year when using transplants or sets, which may result in higher profits if the market demand for the produce is higher. Planting sets or transplants necessitate the use of specialized planting equipment. It is necessary to consider the cost of acquiring the necessary equipment.

In some environments, using sets and transplants exposes the onion to environmental pressures for a shorter period of time, reducing the need for weed and pest control. A precision seed drill and other onion handling equipment are required for direct seeding. For direct seeding, the soil must be tilled, smoothed, and leveled prior to seeding.

Direct seeding requires that each seed be planted at the same depth below the soil surface in order for it to germinate and grow uniformly. Typically, seeds are planted 1 inch deep.

Nursery seeding and transplanting is the most common and practical option in the tropics. Transplants normally have 3 to 5 well-formed leaves at transplant time. Roots are pruned during planting, in order not to be bent upwards when transferred to the field. This facilitates early establishment of the plant.

Any germinated bulb of the above-mentioned varieties would produce 3-6 good size bulbs in about 3 months when planted with the rains. Choose only healthy bulbs for propagation.

Sets are used in some areas in the temperate zones to ensure large bulb size and uniform maturity. Sets are small dry bulbs, approximately 12 mm in diameter, which have been produced the previous season by seeding thickly or growing under conditions that favor rapid bulbing.

Direct seedling is possible and gives excellent results where herbicides can be used and the season is sufficiently long to provide early pre-bulbing growth. In the tropics this method is impractical due to enormous weeding costs in an organic system.

### General Care and Maintenance

Do not plant onions after the field has been planted with other Allium plants (e.g. garlic). Mulching onions with composted leaves and straw is highly recommended to maintain soil organic content, prevent soil-borne diseases, and suppress weeds. Planting onions in raised beds improve drainage and prevents damping-off diseases.

Weeding and harvesting are mostly done by hand, although chemical weed control is possible but not organic. Weed control is a critical part of onion production. Common weeds that affect onion and garlic include yellow nutsedge, field morning glory, cheeseweed, chickweed, henbit, lambs quarters, marestail, pigweed, purslane, shepherdspurse, annual bluegrass, barnyardgrass, and foxtail. Onion transplants and seedlings do not compete well with weeds, so hand cultivation or herbicides are necessary if weeds are a problem. Crop rotation is important to avoid the build-up of pests and diseases such as nematodes, Sclerotium and Fusarium.

### Harvesting

Harvesting takes place 90-150 days after sowing. Onions are ready for harvest when the leaves collapse. Alternatively, the leaves can be bent over and left to dry for 10-12 days. The crop is pulled out by hand and kept for some days in the field with the bulbs covered by the leaves (= windrowing). The leaves are then cut off and the mature bulbs are bagged or packed in crates if they are to be stored.

Freshly harvested onions are dormant and will not sprout for a variable period (this depends on the variety). Storage will extend the dormant period. Sprouting will increase in storage temperatures above 4.4°C. It will decrease again as temperatures exceed 25°C.

### Postharvest Treatment

Onion bulb curing

Following harvest, bulbs are cured to heal wounds and for drying. Curing improves postharvest handling characteristics and limits the entry of organisms through the pseudostems or injured tissues. It also helps the formation of attractive, well-colored, intact outer skins. When weather permits, bulbs are cured in the field for several days, depending on environmental conditions, until the neck has sealed, the outer scales are papery and the wounds have healed.

For field or indoor curing at ambient temperature, bulbs are windrowed to air- dry or placed into well-ventilated boxes or bags, respectively. Onions can also be cured with forced circulation of warm (30°C), low-humidity air through bins or piles of onions placed on slatted floors for 12-24 h. During curing, onion can lose as much as 5% of its initial harvest weight.

### Onion storage

Green onions should be stored at 0°C and 95% RH with a storage life of up to 3 weeks. At 5°C, storage life may be limited to 1 week. Best storage occurs after bulbs have been cured to seal bulbs and heal damage as described above. Onion bulbs do not heal cuts and surface wounds as successfully as other crops such as Irish potato, so mechanical damage during harvest and handling should be minimized before storage.

Decay, sprouting, and rooting cause losses during storage. These losses can be minimized by storage at or near 0°C and 65-70% RH. Storage at high temperatures (25-35°C) may also be satisfactory.

Dry matter and moisture are lost during storage. Most bulbs shrink in size due to respiratory losses and carbohydrate translocation from the outer to inner scales or sprouting roots and shoots. This reallocation of resources causes the succulent outermost scales to gradually desiccate, becoming a dry protective layer, further reducing water loss from the inner scales.

Bulb diameter decreases because of the net loss of succulent scales over time. Onion respiration rates are temperature dependent, decreasing with refrigerated storage. Respiratory heat must be removed by ventilation or refrigeration. Relative humidity influences storage life by reducing shrinkage from water loss. Modified atmosphere storage with elevated CO2 and reduced O2 can extend onion storage life.

As a general rule, long-day types with high solids have longer storage potential than short-day types with low solids. Pungent cultivars generally have longer storage potential than sweet. A fully cured pungent bulb may be stored under optimal conditions for up to 1 year. In contrast, a sweet cultivar may only last 2-3 months under similar conditions.

Bulb rest and dormancy

Onion bulb dormancy is complex with different phases. Onion bulbs first enter a state of rest at harvest maturity that lasts 6-8 weeks. After the rest period, a natural dormancy period begins and bulbs will not sprout or grow because inhibitors synthesized in green leaves earlier in development remain. The inhibitors are gradually destroyed with time. Therefore, it is important to have normal senescence of onion leaves to ensure translocation of inhibitors to the bulb to improve storage life and reduce early sprouting. The change from rest to dormancy is gradual and highly dependent on the cultivar. Dormant bulbs will not sprout at optimal storage temperatures. Once dormancy has passed, root emergence occurs, followed by leaf shoots at favorable temperatures and moisture conditions.

Bulb sprouting and sprout inhibition

Sprouting is optimum at 10-15°C. Sprouting is inhibited at both low and high temperatures as explained above. For long-term storage, a spray inhibitor such as maleic hydrazide (MH) is sometimes used, but it is banned in many countries. MH at a concentration of 2500 ppm is applied at 500 L water/ha. Spray inhibitors are generally applied in the field 1-2 weeks before harvest. If applied too soon, foliage injury occurs and when applied too late, foliar absorption is insufficient to be effective. To improve absorption, applications are made when most of the foliage is still green and when dew is not present. Onions treated with MH and held at a temperature between −1°C and 0°C and 65-70% RH can be stored for as long as 6-7 months without sprouting. Bulb rooting and sprouting are inhibited by gamma irradiation and controlled- atmosphere storage at reduced O2, and continuous removal of newly formed roots tends to delay sprout emergence.

# Orange

## Description

Orange, Citrus sinensis, is an evergreen tree in the family Rutaceae grown for its edible fruit. The orange tree is branched with a rounded crown and possesses elliptical or oval leaves which are alternately arranged on the branches. The leaves have narrowly winged petioles, a feature that distinguishes it from bitter orange, which has broadly winged petioles. The tree produces white flowers singly or clustered on a raceme. The fruit is a spherical berry with a green-yellow to orange skin covered in indented glands and a segmented pulpy flesh and several seeds. Orange trees can grow to a height of 6–15 m (16–49 ft) and can live for periods in excess of 100 years. Most plantations have an economic lifespan of around 30 years. Orange may also be referred to as sweet orange or navel orange and is believed to have originated from a wild ancestor in the border between Vietnam and China.

## Uses

Oranges can be consumed as a fresh fruit and are commonly pressed or squeezed to produce orange juice.Requirements

Orange is a subtropical plant and the trees grow best in regions with a pronounced change in season. They will grow best at temperatures between 12.8 and 37.8°C (55–100°F) during the growing season and 1.7 to 10°C (35–50°F) during dormancy. Mature orange trees can survive short periods of freezing, whereas young trees will be killed. Trees should be protected from frosts and freezing conditions to prevent damage. The trees will also tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water-logged soil. Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development. Orange trees require full sun and should be protected from wind which can cause damage to the trees.

### Orange propagation

Orange seedlings are usually produced by grafting or budding to an appropriate rootstock as seeds will not produce fruit true to type. Grafting is the process by which a scion from one plant is joined to the rootstock of another to produce a new tree. Budding is a special type of grafting where the scion that is joined to the rootstock consists of a single bud. Budding is commonly used in citrus propagation as it is the easier of the two processes and works very well.

### Budding

Budding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6–9 mm/0.25–0.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant). Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden. The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which it will be joined. It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees. The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases which can kill trees. The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks which are 20–25 cm (8–10 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves. These budsticks can be stored for 2–3 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting.

The simplest way to join the budwood the the rootstock is by T-budding. The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut made approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground. Using a sharp knife, a 2.5–3.8 cm (1–1.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark. A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a “T-shape” The horizontal cut should be made a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark. Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud. This piece should measure 1.9–2.5 cm(0.75–1.0 in) in length. Immedietely insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant. Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape.

When the union is made and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem above the join about 2/3 of the way through the stem. This cut should be made 2.5–3.9 cm (1.0–1.5 in) on the same side as the join. The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground. This process, known as “lopping” allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in lengthe, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.

### Planting seedlings

Orange trees can be purchased as seedlings which have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard. The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area. Standard sized trees should be spaced 3.7–7.6 m (12–25 ft) apart in an area that receives full sunlight, but is protected from strong winds which can damage the trees. Planting against a south facing wall will help protect the tree in cooler climates.

### General care

Newly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established. During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil. Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3–7 days. The soil should be moist, but not wet. Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently. Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month  in the first year.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose Colletotrichum gloeosporioides

- Symptoms: Leaves dropping prematurely; leaves covered in dark fungal spores; red to green or black streaks on the mature fruits

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease common during wet Springs or long periods of wet weather late in season

- Management: Management If disease is damaging then appropriate fungicides should be applied to whole tree

#### Armillaria root rot (Mushroom root rot) Armillaria mellea

- Symptoms: Trees may wilt suddenly and collapse or decline slowly; leaves become chlorotic and drop from tree; if large parts of root are destroyed then whole canopy is affected; trunk may have area of rotting bark at the base; lesions on the trunk resemble Phytophthora gummosis; clusters of mushrooms may be present at the bottom of the tree and fan shaped mycelial mats are often present between the bark and the wood

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Healthy trees are usually infected by infected pieces of wood or tree stumps which have been left in the ground after an orchard is cleared

- Management: Management Disease is difficult to control once it becomes established in an orchard; affected trees showing signs of decline should be removed along with as much of the roots system as possible; area where infected tree was should not be replanted with health citrus for a period of at least one year; fumigating soil can help to reduce soil inoculum but is not always completely effective

#### Black root rot Thielaviopsis basicola

- Symptoms: Small brown-black lesions on roots which may coalesce and turn entire root black; root cortex may slough off to reveal the vascular tissue below; leaves of plant may be chlorotic

- Cause: Fungus

#### Huanglongbing (Citrus greening) Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus Candidatus Liberibacter africanus Candidatus Liberibacter americanus

- Symptoms: Leaf symptoms of citrus greening include yellowing of one limb or one area of canopy, yellowing of leaf veins; blotchy mottling and/or green islands (spots) surrounded by completely yellow leaf tissue; twig and limbs begin to die back; fruits may drop prematurely and are often mishappen and lopsided; fruit has a bitter, salty taste

- Cause: Bacteria

- Comments: History Origins and spread Huanglongbing, or citrus greening, was first reported from Southern China in 1919 by American botanist Otto August Reinking who described a “yellow shoot” disease of citrus while evaluating diseases of economic plants in Southern China. A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of “huang long bing”, which translates to “yellow dragon disease”, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees. By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively. The disease has been known by various names in different countries - “greening” in South Africa, “mottle leaf” in the Philippines, “dieback” in India and “vein phloem degeneration” in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia. Biology and ecology The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant. The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter. It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L. africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L. asiaticus , found in .A third species, L. americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements. As this species is found in the same areas as L. asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements. Transmission Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar. Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius, Citrus psyllids Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew. Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed. They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers. When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days. In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur. It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments. Grafting Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956. The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.

- Management: Management Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured. Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus. Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified. In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms. (ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays. Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T. eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk. In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Disease spread from infected grafting material or by aphids

- Management: Management Quarantine procedures are used to control tristeza and prevent the pathogen from entering areas which are currently free of the disease


# Oregano

## Description

Oregano is the name given to many species of perennial herb belonging to the genus Origanum, including the major species Origanum vulgare which is grown for its leaves which are commonly used as a herb in cooking. Oregano plants can be woody or herbaceous and possess multiple branching stems. The leaves are oval or round and are arranged alternately on the stems. The plants produce small pink, purple or white flowers and small oval, brown fruits and can reach up to 1 m (3.3 ft) in height. Oregano is perennial and can be grown for 3–4 years but is commonly grown as an annual in northern climates. Oregano may also be referred to as European oregano or wild marjoram and originated from the Mediterranean.

## Uses

The leaves of the oregano plant are used fresh or dried as a herb in cooking. They may also be dried and used to extract essential oil which is used in soaps or as flavorings in wines and liqueurs.Basic requirements

Oregano is a temperate or subtropical plant and will grow best in ample sunlight but can also be grown in partial shade. The plant grows best in light, well-draining soil with a pH of 4.5–8.7. Oregano will tolerate some cold but will grow best when the annual temperature does not fall below 15°C (59°F).

## Propagation

Oregano can be grown from seeds, cuttings or by division or layering. Vegetative propagation is best for conserving desirable characteristics.

### Seeds

Oregano seeds can be planted indoors to produce transplants or direct seeded. When direct seeding, seeds should be sown in rows spaced 50–60 cm (19–24 in) apart with seedlings thinned to allow 20 cm (8 in) between plants. Seeds will germinate in 4 days at a temperature of 21°C (70°F).

### Cuttings

Root divisions and cuttings are best taken in late Spring when plant growth is at a maximum. Softwood cuttings taken from the new plant growth are quickest to root. Remove portions of stem 7.6–12.7 cm (3–5 in) in length using a sharp knife. Cut the stem at a 45° angle. Plant the cuttings in a light potting medium such as peat moss and vermiculite and keep moist until rooted.

General care and maintenance

Oregano grows very vigorously and requires little care. When the plant has reached approximately 15 cm (6 in) in height, pinching the growing tips will encourage the plant to branch. Oregano may be fertilized on a yearly basis with a balanced fertilizer. Once established, oregano requires little water. Supplemental irrigation may be applied during very dry spells. Divide established plants every few years to promote productivity and prevent the plant from becoming woody.

### Harvesting

Organo is best harvested just before flowering. The entire plant can be harvested by clipping the branches to leave only the lowest set of leaves. The leaves can be used fresh or they can be dried for longer storage. The clipped plant will begin to set out new growth within 2 weeks of harvest.

- Comments: Disease also affects mint and can spread from nearby mint plants

- Management: Management Infected plants and rhizomes should be removed to prevent spread; heat treatment of roots may help to control the disease; roots should be immersed in hot water at 44°C (111°F) for 10 minutes, cooled using cool water and then planted as usual


# Papaya (pawpaw)

## Description

Pawpaw ( Carica papaya L. ) is a popular tropical American fruit. It is commonly cultivated for its small to large melon-like fruit.

The type of inflorescence produced by papaya trees reflects whether the tree is male, female, or hermaphrodite. Male trees have many flowers on long, pendulous panicles, whereas female trees have solitary flowers or clusters of a few yellow-green flowers.

The papaya fruit is a large fleshy berry with smooth green skin that turns yellow or orange when ripe. The fruit's flesh is thick and succulent, ranging in color from yellow to red or orange. Many black wrinkled seeds are present in the fruit.

Papaya trees can live for up to 25 years and grow to a height of 2-10 m (6.6-33 ft). To ensure maximum productivity, plantations are typically replaced every three years.

Papaya, also known as pawpaw, is thought to have originated in the Caribbean region of Central America.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Carica papaya

Common Name: Pawpaw

## Uses & Benefits

The ripe fruits are high in vitamins C and A, which are frequently lacking in the diets of people living in the tropics. Immature fruits are stewed or boiled as a vegetable in some countries, such as the Philippines.

The unripe fruits of the C. papaya tree contain papain, a substance used commercially as a meat tenderizer. Crumpled leaves are used as a meat tenderizer in Southern Asia before wrapping meats.

Papain also has medicinal and industrial applications, such as tanning leather, preventing wool shrinkage, and keeping beer clear during the brewing process.

## Varieties

The following are the most commonly grown pawpaw varieties in Kenya:

Sunrise: Produces high-quality smooth pear-shaped fruits weighing 400-650g.

The flesh of the fruits is reddish-orange, and the variety is prolific.

Mountain: Produces small fruits that are only suitable for jam and preserves.

Solo: Grows small round sweet fruits that are uniform in size and shape.

Red royale F1: This is an improved breed that produces high-quality fruits weighing 1.7-2.3kgs, with a red attractive color and a sweet flavor.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Papaya is a tropical plant that grows best in temperatures ranging from 21 - 33°C in frost-free areas. Papaya can be grown in a variety of soils as long as adequate drainage is provided, but it grows best in light, well-draining soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5.

A monthly rainfall of about 4 inches is required for papaya. Supplemental irrigation should be provided for trees in areas with low rainfall.

Water-logged soils should be avoided because trees are extremely sensitive to flooding. Papaya trees are also susceptible to high winds, and tall trees can easily topple. Planting should be avoided in windy areas.

### Growing from Seed

Pawpaw is almost entirely propagated from seeds in commercial cultivation. Seeds may be sown in trays filled with a suitable medium, peat pots, polyethylene bags, or directly in the field.

Germination occurs in 12-20 days. Seedlings are transplanted into 7.6 cm peat pots or 10 cm plastic bags at the two-leaf (cotyledonary leaves) stage, preferably at the onset of the rainy season.

Care should be taken during transplanting to avoid disturbing the roots. After planting out. Container-grown seedlings should be gradually hardened in sunlight before being field-transplanted 1.5-2 months after germination, at about 20 cm high and at the 8- to 12-leaf stage. Up to 15-20 seeds are sown in each hole during field planting.

Upon germination, seedlings are thinned out to leave five or six seedlings to grow to flower. At first flowering, a vigorous plant of the desired sex is kept and the others removed.

Field preparation in many areas is poorly done due to lack of appropriate equipment or rough terrain. On heavy or compacted soils, subsoiling or ripping down to 50 cm or more is desirable to allow roots to penetrate deeply. Planting holes 30-45 cm in diameter are best dug with a tractor-mounted soil auger. If there is a chance of flooding, raised beds are used.

After about 6-8 weeks in the nursery, the seedlings should reach the 8- to 12-leaf stage and are most suitable for field planting. In rain-fed areas, field planting is done at the beginning of the rainy season. Seedlings grown in pots and bags are planted directly, with the removal of the pot or bags. Transplanted plants must be watered soon after planting to settle the soil around the root system.

Spacing between plants and between rows varies widely. Universally practiced is the single-row system, with plant spacing ranging from 1.8 to 3 m and between-row spacing varying from 1.8 m to as much as 3.6 m. The between-row spacing largely depends upon the degree of mechanization; a standard tractor requires approx. 3 m. The most frequently used spacing is 2.0-2.5 m within row × 2.5 m, giving a density of 1600-2000 plants/ha. The double-row system, with 2 m between a set of rows and 3.5 m between double rows, is used. Normally, two or three seedlings are planted in each hole, spaced about 30 cm apart.

### General Care and Maintenance

Weeds are a major source of competition for papaya seedlings, so keep the areas around the trees weed-free. Weeds can be effectively suppressed by a layer of mulch around the plants.

To meet the nutrient requirements for fruit production, papaya necessitates regular fertilizer applications. Fertilizer is typically applied 2-4 times per year in commercial plantations. In the home garden, 1/4 cup of a balanced fertilizer applied every 14 days is usually sufficient.

The amount of fertilizer should be increased as the trees mature. When the trees are 7 to 8 months old, 1-2 pounds of complete fertilizer should be applied every 2 months.

Papaya trees should be watered regularly, particularly during hot, dry periods. Papaya trees do not require pruning but it is good practice to remove any dead leaves from the tree.

### Harvesting

Papaya fruits typically take 22-26 weeks to mature. The fruits can be picked when one-fifth of the fruit surface has turned from green to yellow, but leaving them on the tree longer increases the fruit's sugar content. Fruit can be twisted or snapped off the tree, or it can be cut using a sharp knife.

# Parsley

## Description

Parsley, Petroselinum crispum is an herbaceous biennial or perennial plant in the family Apiaceae grown for its leaves which are used as a herb. Parsley is an aromatic plant with an erect growth habit and possesses branched, hollow stems and dark green flat or curled leaves which are arranged alternately on the stems. The leaves form a rosette on younger plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on umbels. Parsley can reach 30–100 cm (12 –39 in) in height depending on the variety being grown and is commonly grown as an annual, harvested after one growing season. Parsley may also be referred to as garden parsley and likely originates from the Mediterranean.

## Uses

Parsley leaves are used fresh or dried as a culinary herb. Fresh leaves are also commonly used as a garnish. The taproot of some cultivars is edible and may be eaten as a vegetable. Essential oil can be extracted from the parsley flowers and is used as a flavoring.Basic requirements

Parsley plants will grow best when planted in bright sunlight or partial shade. Plants grow best at temperatures between 7 and 16°C (45–61°F) in a well-draining loam which is high in organic matter. It will grow optimally when the soil pH is between 4.9 and 8.2.

## Propagation

Parsley if propagated from seed, either by direct seeding or sowing indoors to produce transplants. Seeds should be sown in the spring when the soil has warmed. Soaking the seeds overnight prior to planting will aid germination. Seeds should be planted no more than 6 mm (0.25 in) deep using 10 to 15 seeds per inch of row space. Seeds should be kept moist and not allowed to dry out. after emergence, seedlings should be thinned to a final spacing of 10–15 cm (4–6 in) apart, leaving 30–60 cm (12–24 in) between rows. Parsley should be left in the ground for a second year if the collection of seed is desired.

General care and maintenance

Parsley is generally very easy to care for. Keep plants productive by clipping the branches to promote new growth. Remove any flower stalks as they form during the first year of growth to prevent the plant going to seed, retaining the flavor of the leaves. Weeds should be removed from around parsley plants by carefully cultivating the soil. A layer of mulch applied around the plants can help suppress weeds. Fertilizer may be applied to the soil before planting seeds and during the growing season, plants can be side dressed with nitrogen to keep plants productive. Parsley can be overwintered successfully by protecting the plants with a frame or layer of straw. Leaves can be continually harvested over the winter months.

### Harvesting

Parsley is usually ready for harvest about 75 days after sowing, when the plants have reached approximately 20 cm (~8 in) in height. In the home garden, parsley leaves can be harvested as required or whole plants can be harvested and dried for longer storage. If the whole plant is cut, plant growth is usually sufficient to allow for 3 cuttings per year.

# Parsnip

## Description

Parsnip, Pastinaca sativa, is an herbaceous biennial plant in the family Apiaceae grown for its edible taproot resembling a pale carrot.  The parsnip plant has an erect, branched stem with a rosette of leaves which are oblong or triangular in shape and 30–38 cm (12–15 in) in length. The leaves at the top of the plant are smaller and attached directly to the stem.  The plant produces flowers on umbels which are yellow or orange in color with wide petals. The taproot of the plant is thick and fleshy and can grow between 10 and 23 cm (4–9 in) in length.  The parsnip plant may grow to a height of 90–180 cm (35–70 in) in height and is usually grown as an annual for only one growing season.  Parsnip may also be referred to as wild parsnip and originates from the Mediterranean.

## Uses

The parsnip root is primarily eaten as a root vegetable after cooking.  May be sliced and turned into crisps.  The leaves of the plant are also edible and may be cooked and eaten as a vegetable.Basic requirements

Parsnips are cool-season crops which can be planted in early Spring and left in the ground all summer for harvest in the Fall or in the spring of the following year. Parsnips grow best in a well-draining, loose, sandy soil which is free of large rocks and has a pH between 5.8 and 7.5. Parsnips require full sun for optimum development but will tolerate some very light shade. The optimum temperature for their growth is between 15.6 and 18.3°C (60–65°F) and they do not tolerate heat in the same way that carrots do. The plants also require plenty moisture and organic matter. parsnips do very well in raised beds and can also be grown in containers.

### Sowing seeds

Parsnip is usually direct seeded and should be planted 3–5 weeks before the last frost date. Soil should be prepared prior to planting by removing rocks and breaking up any hard lumps down to a depth of at least 30 cm (12 in). It is also beneficial to work some compost into the soil prior to planting. Avoid using fresh manure as it can cause forking of the roots. Sow seeds 1.3–1.9 cm (0.5–0.75 in) deep, planting 2–3 seeds per inch of row allowing 46–61 between rows. When seedlings reach 2.5 cm (1 in) in height, thin them to a final spacing of 5–10 cm (2–4 in) between plants by snipping with scissors - this avoids damaging plant roots.

General care and maintenance

Parsnips benefit from a plentiful moisture supply and should be provided with 2.5 cm (1 in) of water each week. Mulching around the plants helps to conserve moisture and reduce weeds. Plants can also be protected over winter with a thick layer of mulch Any weeds growing around the plants should be carefully removed. The plants should be fertilized 5–6 weeks after the seeds are sown.

### Harvesting

For best results, parsnips should not be harvested until after the first light frosts in Fall, when the tops of the plants have frozen. Frost stimulates the conversion of starch in the roots to sugars giving the roots a sweeter flavor. Care should be taken to harvest before the ground freezes or to cover the plants to prevent freezing. Parsnips are harvested by gently digging around the plant to expose the top of the root and gently, but firmly pulling the root from the soil by grasping the top of the parsnip just above the root. Parsnip tops should be twisted off and the roots washed prior to refrigeration in airtight bags. Parsnips may also be stored in moist sand to keep them fresh prior to use.

# Pea

## Description

Pea, Pisum sativum, is an annual herbaceous legume in the family Fabaceae grown for its edible seeds and seedpods.  The pea plant can be bushy or climbing, with slender stems which attach to a substrate using tendrils.  Each leaf has 1–3 pairs of oval leaflets and can reach 1–6 cm in length.  The plant produces white, red or purple flowers and swollen or compressed green seedpods which can be straight or curved. The pods can range in size from  4 to 15 cm long and 1.5–2.5 cm wide. Each pod contains between 2 and 10 seeds, or peas.  The pea plant is an annual plant, surviving only one growing season and can reach 30–150 cm in height.  Pea may also be referred to as garden pea, English pea or green pea and likely originates from Southwest Asia.

## Uses

Young green seeds and pods can be eaten fresh or cooked as a vegetable.Basic requirements

Peas are cool-season crops and should be grown in early Spring or late summer to avoid high summer temperatures. Peas grow best at temperatures between 15 and 24°C (60–75°F) and are tolerant of frost down to -6.5°C (20°F) although they are generally less sensitive to Spring frost. Pea plants will grow best in soils rich in organic matter with a pH between 5.5 and 7. They should be planted in a well draining soil or raised bed as they do not tolerate too much moisture. Peas perform best in full sunlight although they are also tolerant of partial shade.

### Sowing seeds

Peas should be direct seeded in the garden in Spring as soon as soil is workable and its temperature is above 4.4°C (40°F), or in late summer 8–10 weeks before the first frost date. The optimum soil temperature for germination is 10–25°C(50–77°F), lower temperatures will slow germination. Seeds should be planted 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in) with shallow planting beneficial in soils which are cool and wet. Seeds should be sown 2.5–10.0 cm (1–4 in) apart allowing 45 cm (~18 in) between rows. Seedling should emerge in 9–13 days at a soil temperature of 15.5°C (60°F) and do not require thinning.

General care and maintenance

Tall, vining pea varieties require a trellis to support their growth. Trellises can be made easily out of chicken wire or lengths of string and the plants will begin to grow around them, using tendrils to grip around the support. If growing a variety that requires trellising then the row spacing should be adjusted accordingly. Cool season crops are often attacked by powdery mildew and where the disease is known to be problematic, resistant varieties should be planted.

## Common Pests and Diseases

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease is spread by infected seed; bacterium survives in soil for several months; brown spot more common on plants injured by wind, frost and hail or by mechanical means

- Management: Management Plant only disease-free seed; continuously rotate crops; avoid planting peas in fall when they are more likely to be injured by inclement weather

#### Downy mildew Peronospora viciae

- Symptoms: Yellow-brown blotches on upper surface of leaves; angular patches of fluffy white-gray fungus on lower side of leaves; plant growth may be stunted or distorted and whole plant may die before flowering; plant may produce

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters in soil and on crop debris; fungus can survive in soil for 10-15 years

- Management: Management Rotate crops for at least 5 years; till crop debris deeply; avoid sowing pea in late Autumn at greater soil depths as this can promote severe infections

#### Fusarium root rot Fusarium solani

- Symptoms: Stunted plant growth; yellowing, necrotic basal leaves; brown-red or black streaks on roots that coalesce as they mature; lesions may spread above the soil line

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Damage caused by the emergence of the disease is worsened by warm, compacted soils, limited soil moisture and poor soil fertility

- Management: Management There are currently no pea varieties with resistance to Fusarium root rot so control relies on cultural practices e.g. do not plant peas in same area more than once in any 5 year span or treating seeds with an appropriate fungicide prior to planting

#### Gray mold (Botrytis mold) Botrytis cinerea

- Symptoms: Fuzzy gray elongated lesions whoch girdle stem causing wilting of upper parts of plant; lower leaves may be covered in fuzzy gray growth which causes them to dry out and shrivel; small, oval, water-soaked lesions on pods which are tan in color; pod lesions spread irregularly and become gray and sunken; young pods may shrivel and become covered in fuzzy, gray mycelial growth

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus survives in or on crop debris in soil; disease spreads by splashing water and on equipment under favorable conditions

- Management: Management There is no reported resistance to gray mold in pea; potassium deficiency may make plants more susceptible and should be supplemented in deficient soils; the fungus causing gray mold has developed resistance to many systemic fungicides and control relies on the application of an appropriate protective fungicides if flowering and pod set coincides with wet weather

#### Powdery mildew Erysiphe pisi

- Symptoms: Yellow spots on upper surface of leaves; powdery gray-white areas which coalesce to cover entire plant; if plant is heavily infected it may appear light blue or gray in color

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial blight Pseudomonas syrngae

- Symptoms: Small, water-soaked spots on leaves steam and pods which coalesce and turn brown and necrotic; lesions on leaves are angular and develop translucent centers; lesions on stem may enlarge and girdle stem, killing plant parts above; lesions on pods may cause seeds to be covered in slime

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease is spread both in and on seed and can survive like this for 3 years; if infected seed is used, the whole pea crop can be lost if conditions are favorable to the bacterium

- Management: Management Plant resistant varieties; plant only disease-free seed; disinfect all tools and equipment regularly; avoid sprinkler irrigation

#### Streak Pea streak virus (PSV)

- Symptoms: Purple or brown necrotic streaks on stems and petioles; small brown necrotic lesions on leaves; brown, sunken lesions on pods; pods fail to fill properly or do not fill at all; pods discolored; dieback of growing tips; chlorosis of leaves

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Transmitted by pea aphids; alfalfa most important perennial virus reservoir

- Management: Management No resistance to virus; avoid planting peas close to established alfalfa; insecticide application of little benefit due to short time aphid requires to transmit virus but can help control secondary spread

- Management: Management In areas where virus is a problem, early planting may allow plants to mature before virus becomes severley damaging; control of aphid populations and hosts plants which act as reservoirs can help control spread of virus

#### Mosaic Red clover vein mosaic virus (RCVMV)

- Symptoms: Mottled patterns on leaves; yellow leaf veins; distorted leaves; stunted plants which often die

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Virus transmitted by aphids; aphids acquire virus from perennial hosts such as clover and alfalfa and spread to peas

- Management: Management No known resistance to virus, control depends on control of aphid populations; apply appropriate insecticide if aphid populations are significant


# Peach

## Description

Peach, Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree or shrub in the family Rosaceae grown for its edible fruit of the same name. The peach tree is relatively short with slender and and supple branches. The leaves are alternately arranged, slender and pointed. The tree produces pink flowers which have five petals and emerge in January and February. The fruit is a velvety, soft, fleshy red to yellow-orange fruit which is oval in shape and 3-8 cm in diameter. Peach trees can grow up to 8 m (19 ft) in height and produce fruit for 10 to 20 years. Peach may also be referred to as nectarine, the two fruits belonging to the same species, although nectarines have smooth skin, and are believed to have originated in China.

## Uses

Peach trees are primarily grown for their fruit which is consumed fresh. Peach trees are also grown as ornamental plants.Basic requirements

Peaches grow best in areas with warm summers and require  a summer temperature between 20 and 30°C (68-86°F) for the fruit to mature. The trees also have a chilling requirement to break dormancy but fruit buds can be damaged by prolonged periods below -15°C (5°F) and as such, the majority of production takes place in countries which are relatively close to the equator. In addition, peach trees bloom early and can be damaged by late frosts. Trees grow best in well-draining sandy loams in areas that receive full sun but can will grow in a variety of soils as long as water does not sit on the surface after heavy rainfall. It can be beneficial to plant the trees on elevated land to allow cold air to drain away. Trees will grow optimally in soils with a pH of 6.5.

## Propagation

Peach trees are propagated vegetatively to maintain the desirable genetic characteristic of the parent. Commercial trees are usually propagated by T-budding in the summer. T-budding involves joining a bud from a desired variety onto an appropriate rootstock. Buds can also be collected late in the summer for budding during dormancy. The budwood should be collected from healthy shoots of current season growth, leaves removed and the budwood kept moist until the union with the rootstock is made. The budwood is joined to the rootstock by inserting the bud stick into a T-shaped cut on the bark of the rootstock and allowing it to grow. The rest of the tree is pruned to force the growth of the new bud which has the desired characteristics.

### Planting

Peach trees should be planted in full sun. Plant bare root trees in a pre-dug hole which is  slightly wider than the root ball. Backfill the hole so that the tree is planted to its original planting depth ensuring that the bud union is above the soil line. It is usually possible to identify this from changes in the color of the bark. If planting multiple trees, space them at least 7.6 m (25 ft) apart.

General care and maintenance

Peaches should be pruned annually, including the year of planting and are best trained to an open center. When the tree is bearing fruit, it is important to thin the fruits to prevent the tree from over-bearing. Aim to have 1 fruit every 8 inches. This allows fruits to become larger and prevents the tree from reducing production the following year. Trees should be watered regularly during the growing season to aid with fruit development. During dry periods, water trees every 10 to 14 days. Apply water deeply and widely, to at least the width of the canopy. Trees will also benefit from the application of a nitrogen fertilizer in Spring.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial canker Pseudomonas syringae

- Symptoms: Cankers on twigs at bases of flower and leaf buds, in pruning wounds or at the base of spurs which exude amber colored gum; cankers spread upwards and form sunken areas in winter; if pathogen enters dormant buds they may be killed or open normally in Spring before collapsing in early Summer; infected buds may be symptomless

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease emergence favors high moisture and low temperatures in the spring; young trees particularly susceptible; trees grown in sandy soils that drain poorly are also susceptible

- Management: Management Ensure that a suitable peach variety and rootstock is chosen based on geographic location and environmental conditions to prevent stress to tree which predisposes tree to canker disease; apply protective copper spray to trees before flowering; prune trees in early summer to decrease likelihood of infection

#### Bacterial spot Xanthomonas campestris

- Symptoms: Water soaked, angular gray lesions on the underside of the leaves which turn purple and necrotic in the center and cause a shot hole appearance if lesion center drops out; if lesions are present in high numbers on leaves they may become chlorotic and drop from tree; cankers develop on twigs either as raised blisters or as a dark area surrounding a bud that fails to open; in years of severe infection the entire fruit crop may be lost; lesions on fruit begin as small brown, water-soaked lesions which may exude gum

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Periods of frequent rainfall during late bloom and early petal drop increase likelihood of fruit and leaf infection; infection is rare during hot, dry weather

- Management: Management Avoid planting susceptible peach varieties in areas where disease is known; once disease is visible it can be difficult to control, protective copper applications in the Fall prior to leaf drop and/or application in early growing season may help prevent the disease; care should be taken as peach trees are very sensitive to copper

#### Crown gall Agrobacterium spp

- Symptoms: Galls on roots and/or crown of tree which can range in size from so small they are not visible to the naked eye up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter; galls first become visible as white, fleshy swellings that grow rapidly and become tan to brown in color; galls typically develop at the site of a wound and new galls form adjacent to old ones the next year

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Infection with crown gall begins at the site of plant wounds; disease emergence is favored by poorly-drained, alkaline soils and previous feeding damage by nematodes

- Management: Management Chemical control of the disease is generally ineffective; an effective bacterial biological control is available for commercial production; cultural control methods include: planting only certified, disease-free material, planting peach in well-draining soil, rotating infected fields with a non-host before peach is planted and also using good sanitation practices

#### Scab Cladosporium carpophilum

- Symptoms: Small, green to olive circular spots on surface of fruit, usually close to stem end, which enlarge, darken and develop a green or yellow halo; lesions may coalesce and cause fruit surface to crack; lesions on infected green twigs are hardly visible to start off with but become brown with a raised border before turning purple or dark brown; infected leaves develop angular or circular lesions on the lower surface which are initially a similar color to the leaf but turn olive green as they mature; leaf lesions may coalesce to form chlorotic patches; defoliation may occur

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters in in twig lesions or on bark surface

- Management: Management Control currently relies completely on the use of fungicides; pruning the tree canopy promotes good air circulation and allows light to penetrate which can help control scab

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Brown rot Monilinia fructicola

- Symptoms: Brown discoloration of fruit skin and inner tissue; fruit skin wrinkled; collapsed flowers exuding sap from their bases; tan cankers with dark edges on twigs; gray-brown spore masses may be present on cankers

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus survives in mummified fruit on the tree, blighted blossoms, cankers and infected twigs; blossom and twig blights are promoted by periods of wet weather

- Management: Management The currently most effective method of controlling brown rot is through the application of appropriate protective fungicides timed so that they are applied when the susceptible flower parts are exposed or after a wet period; avoiding sprinkler irrigation protects the leaves and flowers from wetness that promotes the disease. Cultural control methods include: removing mummified fruit from tree, pruning infected twigs and reducing plant stress by providing adequate levels of water and fertilizer

#### Rust Tranzschelia discolor

- Symptoms: Pale yellow-green spots on both upper and lower leaf surfaces which are angular in shape and turn bright yellow in color; spots on lower leaf surface develop orange-red spores

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters in twigs or in leaves which remain attached to the tree

- Management: Management Rust can be prevented by spraying trees with protective fungicides; application is usually carried out one, two and three months before harvest in areas prone to early season outbreaks of the disease and after harvest in areas where disease is less problematic or emerges later in the season

#### Shot hole disease Wilsonomyces carpophilus

- Symptoms: Brown lesions with purple edge on fruit, twigs and buds; holes in leaves due to lesions which have dried and dropped out; brown lumps developing in the center of lesion (visible with hand lens); buds turning brown or black and exuding sap; tan lesions with brown margins which exude sap on twigs

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors wet, windy conditions

- Management: Management Application of Bordeaux mixture before rains in Fall are sufficient to protect dormant buds and twigs over winter

#### Silver leaf disease Chondrosterum pupureum

- Symptoms: Leaves have a silvery appearance; if infection is severe the leaves may curl upwards and become necrotic; death of individual limbs or entire tree may occur; fungal fruiting bodies appear on the surface of the dead bark

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Pathogen is spread via spores released after rainfall during periods of high humidity and can enter trees through pruning wounds; risk of infection is increased if tree is pruned during late winter or early spring; trees also susceptible when they are heavily pruned

- Management: Management Control of silver leaf disease is difficult and infection can be widespread after rainfall in areas where the disease is present; strategies to reduce the incidence of the disease include: removing all plant debris e.g. pruning waste, stumps, and logs; pruning tree during dry periods and treating large pruning wounds with fungicidal dressing

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Leaf curl Taphrina deformans

- Symptoms: Yellow to red patches on young leaves in Spring which thicken and pucker causing leaf to curl; puckered parts of leaf may develop white covering; infected leaves may drop from plant or remain attached and turn dark brown; infection of fruit is rare but causes irregular, raised and wrinkled red lesions

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Emergence of leaf curl is promoted by periods of cool, wet weather during the early stages of bud development

- Management: Management The primary method of controlling peach leaf curl is the application of appropriate fungicides and/or planting resistant peach varieties; no peach varieties are completely resistant to leaf curl

#### Plum pox virus Plum pox virus (PPV)

- Symptoms: First expanding leaves exhibit chlorotic veinclearing and veinbanding; lamina twisted and distorted; fruit show dark rings, lines and spots; symptoms on fruti may disappear on ripening; fruit may be deformed

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Virus is transmitted by aphids but most common method of spread is diseased plant material

- Management: Management Plant certified healthy material; remove infected trees from orchard; chemical sprays to control aphids may prolong spread of virus

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Phytophthora root and crown rot Phytophthora spp.

- Symptoms: Poor new growth; leaves chlorotic, small in size and sparse; fruit may be small, brightly colored and susceptible to sunburn; shoots may suffer from dieback and tree will often die within weeks or months of first signs of infection or decline gradually over several seasons; root crown may show signs of decay which develops into a canker; bark of infected crown tissue turns dark brown; cankers may occur on aerial parts of plant

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Severity of disease is linked to soil moisture content; water-saturated soils promote development of fungus

- Management: Management Management of phytophthora is reliant on good management of water: peach trees should be planted in well-draining soil to minimize the frequency and duration of water saturated soil; trees should be propagated from resistant rootstock and application of appropriate systemic fungicides may provide some protection from the disease


# Peanut (groundnut)

## Scientific Clarification

The following are the crop details for Groundnuts

## General Information

Groundnuts are small erect or trailing herbaceous legumes, about 15 to 60 cm high. The fruit is a pod with one to five seeds that develop underground within a needle-like structure called a peg.

The leaves are arranged in alternate pairs and have leaf-like attachments near the stalk. The groundnut plant produces yellow, orange, cream, or white flowers which produce 'pegs', characteristic floral structures which sink into the ground to grow the pod. The pods can reach up to 10 cm (4 in) in length and can contain between 1 and 5 seeds. The plant can reach 0.6 m (2 ft) in height depending on the variety and as an annual plant, survives only one growing season.

The seeds are rich in oil (38-50%), protein, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamins.

Groundnuts also have considerable medicinal value. They are reported to be useful in the treatment of diseases such as hemophilia, stomatitis, and diarrhea.

In sub-Saharan Africa, groundnuts are a basic staple crop, cultivated mainly by small-scale farmers both as subsistence and as a cash crop. It is an important source of protein and other nutrients for poor rural communities. In Africa, groundnut yields are traditionally low, due to unreliable rains, little technology available to small-scale farmers, pest and disease occurrence, poor seed variety, and increased cultivation on marginal land (ICRISAT).

Groundnuts may also be referred to as peanut, monkeynut, or earth nut. Groundnuts originated in South America from southern Bolivia to north-western Argentina. The Portuguese took them from Brazil to West Africa and then to southwestern India in the 16th century. Africa is now regarded as a secondary center of diversity.

## Groundnut Varieties in Kenya

There are two main varieties of groundnuts in Kenya:

The runner is a large variety and it's highly preferred because of high yields, it matures in 90-100 days. Bunch varieties are small, tastier, and highly marketable, it matures in 60- 75 days.

Other varieties include Red Valencia, Red Oriata, Manipinta, Makulu Red, Bukene, Homa Bay, Texas Peanut, and Atika.

Red Valencia: This variety is easy to grow and produces two to five kernels per long pod. It’s slightly smaller in size and has a sweeter taste with papery red seed covers.

## Climate Conditions, Soil, and Water Management

Groundnuts are grown in most tropical, subtropical, and temperate countries between 40°N and 40°S latitude, especially in Africa, Asia, North, and South America. They are grown in the warm tropics and subtropics below 1500 m above sea level, and in temperate humid regions with sufficiently long warm summers. The optimum mean daily temperature to grow is 30°C and growth ceases at 15°C. Cool temperatures delay flowering. Groundnuts cannot stand frost. Between 500 and 600 mm of water reasonably well distributed through the growing season allows good production.

Groundnuts are drought-tolerant species and can withstand severe lack of water, but the yield is generally reduced. If harvesting conditions are wet, aflatoxins (severe poison produced by some fungi such as Aspergillus spp) may develop on the nuts. Aflatoxin contamination is a major hazard to human and animal health. When groundnuts are poorly dried and stored, they pick mold and dirt, which attracts fungi, that release aflatoxin chemicals that are dangerous to human health, especially the liver.

Pods develop underground and must be recovered at harvest, therefore crumbly, well-drained soils are preferred, but plants grow and develop adequately on heavier clay soils. For optimum growth, soil pH should be in the range of 5.5 to 6.5, though Bunch types tolerate more acidic conditions (pH 4.5) and some cultivars grow well in alkaline soils up to pH 8.5.

## Uses

Most commercially grown peanuts are used for the extraction of their oil which is used in cooking. The by-product of oil extraction is a pressed cake which is used as animal feed and also in the production of peanut flour. Raw kernels are also commonly roasted and eaten as a snack food.

The vegetative residues from the crop are excellent forage.

## Planting Procedure

Peanut is usually propagated from seed. Seeds should be planted in a well- prepared seedbed in soil that is loose and crumbly with no large clumps. The seedbed should be free from weeds which will compete with the peanut seedlings. Weeds may be removed by hand cultivating or through the use of an appropriate herbicide. Peanut seeds should be planted by hand to a depth of 3–5 cm (1–2 in). It is best to ridge the soil or use flat beds as this will make harvesting the peanuts easier.

After ploughing and harrowing to a fairly good tilth, ridges that are 80 cm apart with flattish tops, should be made so that two rows of nuts can be planted on each ridge. Seeds for planting should be well selected: they should be clean, well-filled, and without any blemishes. Seeds should be kept in their pods and shelled a few days before planting. Planting depth is like maize about 5 to 8 cm. Seed rate is 40 to 50 kg/ha depending on the size of the seeds.

## Intercropping

They can be grown as a sole crop and also intercropped with maize, soybean, and cassava. It is also a good intercrop for upland rice, sorghum, okra, sugarcane, and sunflower.

In some areas, they are grown under perennial tree crops such as coconut, oil palm, or rubber. Groundnuts when used as intercrop for upland maize and planted along the contour reduce soil runoff. The plant also reduces the population of African bollworms because it serves as a hiding place for beneficial insects. There is an increase in the yield of groundnuts when intercropped with early-maturing pigeon peas.

## Husbandry

To achieve maximum economic yields, weeds must be eliminated. Groundnuts are poor competitors with weeds during the early stages of growth. Weeding should be done early while at the same time earthing up the ridges to encourage "pegging" i.e. young nuts penetration through the soil. Once pegging has started, only hand weeding should be undertaken to avoid disturbing the young nuts or damaging the flowers. Clean weeding should be done in up to 6 weeks after which hand weeding should take over.

The only peculiar nutrient requirement is for calcium (Ca) in the podding zone. Calcium is absorbed directly by the pods if soil moisture is adequate. A shortage of Ca in that zone will result in empty pods (especially in Runner cultivars). The crop's needs for nitrogen should be satisfied with symbiotic fixation by strains of Rhizobium of the cowpea group, so nitrogen fertilizers are not generally required.

In some areas of acid soils, lime is applied to raise the pH and supply Ca. Moisture stress during flowering or pod filling reduces yield therefore irrigation is important during those periods to minimize or eliminate the stress, and increase production and seed quality. Where yields are unsatisfactory (heavily eroded soils) an application of 200 kg/ha of rock phosphate is recommended.

## Harvesting

Bunch cultivars are harvested 85-100 days after sowing and Runner cultivars 110-130 days after sowing in the warm tropics. Dig a few plants up to see if the nuts are ready. The nuts should be brown on the outside, firm, and dry. Usually, at maturity the inside of the pods is grey and some rattling occurs when pods are shaken. Severe disease of foliage sometimes results in harvesting before seeds are fully mature.

Plants should be carefully dug out to avoid nuts breaking off and remaining in the ground. Dry for 2-3 days, then rip the pods from the bushes and place them on mats to dry for another 7-10 days to about 10% moisture.

Shelling should be done by hand. Broken, dirty, or damaged nuts should be discarded as these will lower the quality and hence the selling price. When the groundnuts are poorly dried and stored, they pick mold and dirt, which attracts fungi, that release aflatoxin chemicals that are dangerous to human health, especially the liver. Nuts to be used as seeds the following year should not be shelled.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Botrytis blight Botrytis cinerea

- Symptoms: Numerous spots on upper surface of leaflets; entire plant or discrete parts may wilt and die; pods and stems become covered in fungal sclerotia.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors high moisture and high temperature; plants damaged by frost or other pathogens are particularly vulnerable to attack.

- Management: Management Avoiding frost damage by planting early peanut varieties can help protect the plant from fungal colonization; application of appropriate foliar fungicides (e.g. benomyl), where available, can help to control the disease.

#### Charcoal rot Macrophomina phaseolina

- Symptoms: Water soaked lesions on stems of seedlings close to soil line; lesions girdle stem and kill seedlings; lesions in similar area may be present in older plants; lesions are initially water-soaked but turn brown; if lesions girdle the stem, plant wilts and branches die; infections beginning in the roots cause leaves to turn yellow and wilt and causes stems to be blighted.

- Cause: Fugnus

- Comments: Fungus survives in crop debris in the soil; disease emergence is favored by high soil temperatures which cause plants to be water stressed and more susceptible to disease; fungus can survive for prolonged periods in dry soils but are killed in wet soil.

- Management: Management Rotating crop with rice for a period of 3-4 years can reduce the level of oioculum in the soil; providing the plants with adequate irrigation and fertilization reduces susceptibility to the disease; there are currently no resistant varieties of peanut; frequent irrigation to wet soil reduces the incidence of the disease.

#### Cylindrocladium black rot Cylindrocladium crotalariae

- Symptoms: Leaves on main stem turning chlorotic and wilting; entire plant wilts very rapidly when there is a period of water stress following high moisture; clusters of red-brown fungal bodies occur on on stems, pegs and pods; roots destroyed; roots blackened and shriveled.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Crops planted early are more susceptible to the disease as they are often exposed to cooler temperatures and higher soil moisture; disease is seed transmitted and also can spread over long distances by wind.

- Management: Management The most effective method to control the disease is to plant peanut varieties that have some resistance to the disease; rotation of crop with nonhost such as corn , cotton or tobacco may help to reduce inoculum in the soil; application of appropriate soil fumigants in heavily infested fields can help to control the disease.

#### Early leaf spot Cercospora arachidicola

- Symptoms: Small chlorotic flecks on leaf petioles, stems and pegs which enlarge and turn dark in color; lesions on upper surface of leaves usually possess a yellow halo and are reddish brown on the underside of leaves.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence is favored by high humidity and warm temperatures; spread of the disease is promoted by pronlonged leaf wetness.

- Management: Management If disease is present, a rotation away from peanut for a period of 2-3 years is advised but is insufficient to control the disease completely; peanut crop debris should be plowed into soil after harvest and any volunteers removed from the nonhost crop; fungicides should be applied with caution as they can exacerbate other foliar diseases where they are present.

#### Late leaf spot Cercospora personatum

- Symptoms: Small chlorotic flecks on leaf petioles, stems and pegs which enlarge and turn dark in color; symptoms may be very similar or identical to early leaf spot and can only be differentiated by examination of conidia under a microscope.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence is favored by high humidity and warm temperatures; spread of the disease is promoted by pronlonged leaf wetness.

- Management: Management If disease is present, a rotation away from peanut for a period of 2-3 years is advised but is insufficient to control the disease completely; peanut crop depris should be plowed into soil after harvest and any volunteers removed from the nonhost crop; fungicides should be applied with caution as they can exacerbate other foliar diseases where they are present.

#### Phyllostica leaf spot Phyllostica arachidis-hypogaea

- Symptoms: Circular lesions with red-brown margins and light brown or tan centers on leaves; centers of lesions may dry out and drop from leaf resulting in a "shot-hole" appearance.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Phyllostica leaf spot is known to occur in the U.S., India, China, Argentina, Thailand, the Philippenes, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Niger and Burkino Faso.

- Management: Management Disease is held in check by fungicides applied to control early or late leaf spot.

#### Rust Puccinia arachidis

- Symptoms: Characteristic orange pustules on undersides of leaves which become covered in masses of red-brown spores; pustules may form on pods.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Peanut rust is highly specific to peanut; disease emergence and spread is favored by warm temperatures followed by leaf wetness.

- Management: Management Allow field to fallow for at least one month between successive peanut plantings; remove any volunteer peanut plants during fallowing to reduce inoculum; sprays of appropriate fungicides such as Bordeaux mixture can effectively control the disease; such fungicides are often also effective at controlling leaf spot.

#### Sclerotinia blight Sclerotinia minor

- Symptoms: Tips of infected branches wilt or flag rapidly; early signs of infection include the presence of small water-soaked lesions at the base of the stems which turn yellow or bleached; leaves on infected branches turn chlorotic and then wither; fluffy white fungal growth may appear on infected tissues during periods of high humidity.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus can survive for prolonged periods in the soil, even in the absence of peanut; emergence of the disease in the peanut crop is favored by periods of cool weather, moist soil and high humidity.

- Management: Management Plant seeds which are coated with protectants; avoid injuring plants with tools and/or machinery; application of appropriate fungicides can reduce crop losses when disease is present; avoid excessive irrigation during cool weather.

#### Southern stem rot Sclerotium rolfsii

- Symptoms: Lateral branches or main stem yellowing and wilting; white fungal mat developing on the stem close to the soil line; white to brown spore containing structures developing from the fungal mats.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Pathogen has a large host range and attacks many crops including sugar beets; disease favors dry soils which crack deeply, allowing the penetration of oxygen.

- Management: Management Plow crop debris deeply into soil after harvest of crop; crop rotation of 3-4 years are very effective at reducing soil inoculum in the case of severe infestations; applications of appropriate fungicides can help suppress stem rot but care should be taken with selection as some pesticides (e.g. benomyl) are known to increase the severity of the the disease.

#### Verticillium wilt Verticillium spp.

- Symptoms: Chlorosis of leaf margins; curling leaves; loss of leaf turgor; plants wilt and become stunted as the disease progresses; plants wilt rapidly during periods of water stress; vascular system becomes dicolored.

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Fungus can survive in the soil for several years; disease is spread to uninfested fields by movement of infested soil or contaminated tools and machinery; there are no peanut varieties known to have resistance to the disease.

- Management: Management Irrigate plants frequently to reduce wilting of infected plants and allow them to reach maturity; eliminate weeds int he plantation which may allow inoculum to build up in the soil; remove and destroy infected crop residue after harvest to reduce inoculum in the field.

#### Web blotch (Phoma leaf spot) Phoma arachidicola

- Symptoms: Circular, brown-black lesions on the upper surfaces of the leave; web or net- like brown lesions on leaves may form on leaves during periods of high humidity; as sisease progresses, lesions darken and develop a rough texture; lesions may cover entire leaf surface.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence is favored by cool, moist conditions and periods of prolonged leaf wetness.

- Management: Management Remove and destroy infested crop debris to prevent build up of inoculum in soil; rotate crops away from peanut; foliar fungicide applications are largely ineffective if conditions are favorable for the disease.

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Stunt Peanut stunt virus (PSV)

- Symptoms: Leaves curled and pale yellow to green; leaf petioles shortened; plants growth severely stunted; plants may produce very few pods if they have been infected early in the growing season.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: PSV is transmitted by aphids; legumes such as white clover are the primary source of inoculum.

- Management: Management Avoid planting peanut in close proximity to legumes such as clover; remove any infected plants from plantation to reduce inoculum.

#### Tomato spotted wilt virus & Peanut bud necrosis Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) Peanut bud necrosis virus (PBNV)

- Symptoms: Chlorotic spots or mottled patterns on leaves; drooping leaflets during hot weather; necrosis of terminal buds; stunted growth; new leaflets are reduced in size and may be puckered with mosaic mottling.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Both viruses have an extremely wide host range and are transmitted by thrips vectors.

- Management: Management Use high quality seed and use adequate plant spacings to avoid overcrowding; provide plants with adequate irrigation and fertilization to encourage the fast establishment of seedlings and growth of a close canopy which is unattractive to thrips vectors; intercropping peanut with sorghum or millet can reduce disease incidence.


# Pear

## Description

The European pear, Pyrus communis, is a perennial deciduous tree in the family Rosaceae, grown for its fruit. The tree is a short deciduous tree with a tall and narrow crown and alternately arranged, simple leaves. The leaves are elliptical with finely serrated margins and defined tips and can reach 2–12 cm (0.7–4.7 in) in length.  The tree produces white flowers which are 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter and a fleshy green pyriform fruit. Pear trees can reach 9 m (30ft) and will produce fruit for about 20 years . The European pear may be referred to by name of its cultivars which include the Bartlett, d'Anjou, Kaiser Alexander and Comice pears. The European pear occurs only as cultivated trees and does not grow wild in nature. It is descendant of wild European and Asian pear trees.

## Uses

The pear fruit is eaten fresh or can be cooked in a range of sweet dishes. The fruit may also be pressed for juice. The leaves of the tree can be used to produce dyes and the wood can be used in carpentry and is very durable.Basic requirements

Pears grow very well in areas that have a late frost and a cool, dry summer and will grow at temperatures between -26 and 45°C (-14.8–133°F). Pear trees have a chilling requirement of between 1000 and 1500 hours between 0 and 7°C (32–44.6°F) to break dormancy depending on the particular variety being grown. Generally, trees must cross pollinate with a different variety in order to successfully set fruit. Pear trees require a deep, well draining soil with a pH of 6–7 and will grow in sandy, medium or heavy soil. Pear trees are the most tolerant of all fruit trees of wet soils but roots should not be waterlogged for more than a few days at a time.

## Propagation

Pear trees are propagated by budding onto suitable rootstocks. Rootstocks are usually also pear but quince is also used in warmer growing regions. Pear trees are usually acquired from the nursery as bare-rooted seedlings. They are planted by digging a whole which is large enough to accommodate the outstretched roots of the tree without bending. The graft union should be at least 10–15 cm (4–6 in) above the soil line.Trees should be spaced 4.8 m (16 ft) apart, leaving  7.5 m (25 ft) between rows. The best time for planting is in early Spring or Fall while the trees are still dormant. Young trees are susceptible to wind damage and should be provided with a wind break.

Training and pruning

Pear trees are usually trained in the same way is apple trees and often they follow a central leader system. The central leader system encourages earlier fruiting and is recommended for European pear varieties. The system consists of one main trunk which gives rise to 12 t0 16 primary scaffold branches. The tree becomes conical in shape, being wider at the bottom and narrower at the top. The shape is achieved through selective pruning of the branches in the years after planting. At time of planting, the tree is headed back by cutting the leader at a height of approximately 90 cm (36 in) from the ground. All branched lower than 76 cm (30 in) from the ground should also be removed at this time alongside and damaged or broken branches and those with narrow crotch angles. In the first winter following planting, the longest, most vigorous, vertical shoot should be selected as the leader and other vigorous shoots with narrow crotch angles removed. Branches with wide crotch angles (>40°) can be left on the tree and corrected with spacers (lengths of wire secured around the branch to correct the growth angle). Each year, while the tree is dormant, the central leader should be headed back by about 1/3 of its length and any vigorous, competing branches with narrow crotch angles removed. After the tree has fruited for two years, some branches will need removed to open up the canopy.

General care and maintenance

The amount of fertilizer that should be supplied to pear trees depends on the soil type and composition and should be checked with the aid of a soil test. Less nitrogen is supplied to pear trees than to apple as it promotes vigorous growth, increasing susceptibility to fire blight. in the first year of growth, phosphorous and potassium may be required but in subsequent years, only nitrogen is generally added to the soil. The area around the base of the pear tree should be kept free from weeds which compete for water and nutrients. In commercial plantations, appropriate herbicides may be used for weed control. In the home garden, weeds can be removed by hand. Pear trees may require fruit to be thinned to prevent over production which can lead to reduced yields in subsequent years or cause damage to the tree through excess weight. fruits should be thinned early in the season to a final density of approximately 1 fruit every 15 cm (6 in).

### Harvesting

Pear fruits are usually harvested when mature, but are are ripened off of the tree. Pear allowed to ripen on the tree tend to ripen from the core outwards, resulting in fruit with mushy centers. It can be difficult to determine the correct time to harvest pears and so a variety of factors should be taken into consideration prior to picking. One of the most common indicators of maturity is the firmness of the fruit. Commercial plantations use devices called penetrometers to determine fruit firmness. Pears should be harvested when the reading is between 16 and 19 pounds.

# Pearl Millet

## Description

Pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum, is an annual grass in the family Poaceae which is grown widely in Africa and India for its grain which can be used to make flour and other foodstuffs. Pearl millet is a very robust grass which tillers widely and grows in tufts. It has slender stems which are divided into distinct nodes. The leaves of the plant are linear or lance-like, possess small teeth and can grow up to 1 m (3.3 ft) in length. The inflorescence of the plant is a spike-like panicle, made up of many smaller spikelets where the grain is produced. Pearl millet can reach 0.5 to 4 m (1.6–13.1 ft) in height depending on the cultivar and  is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season. Pearl millet may also be referred to as bulrush millet, cat-tail millet or yellow bristle grass and originates from the Sahel zone of Africa.

Synonyms are P. americanum (L.) Leeke, and P. typhoides (Burm.) Stapf. & Hubb.) And common names include  bullrush millet, cat-tail-millet, mil-a-chandelle, bajra, kambu, duhkn.

## Uses

Pearl millet grain can be ground into flour and used to produce porridge, or a type of flat bread. It can also be cooked and prepared in a manner similar to couscous or rice. The plant stems can be used for roof thatch and building construction. In countries other than Africa and India it is most widely grown as fodder.Basic requirements

Pearl millet is adapted for growth in dry conditions where there is low rainfall. It is a warm season crop which will produce tillers at temperatures of 21–24°C (69.8–75.2°F) and develop spikelets at the slightly higher temperature of 25°C (77°F). Pearl millet is tolerant of a variety of soils, including acidic and sandy soils and those which are nutrient poor but it will not tolerate waterlogging. The plants will grow optimally in a well-draining, fertile soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.

## Propagation

Pearl millet is propagated directly from seed. Pearl millet seed is usually sown directly on fields on hills or ridges with short lived cultivars being planted as soon as possible after the wet season in semi-tropical regions. A well-prepared seedbed is important to ensure rapid development of seedlings. Pearl millet seeds are best sown when the soil has warmed to at least 20°C (68°F). Seed can be sown in furrows if the soil is light or if the plant is being grown in drier areas, or by broadcasting. Seeding rates vary from 12–15 lb of seed per acre when using a seed drill, to 30–40 lb per acre when seed is broadcast. A distance of 45–60 cm (17.7–23.6 in) is usually allowed between rows.

General care and maintenance

Pearl millet is a fast growing crop that will quickly be able to outcompete weeds. It is, however, important to maintain a weed-free seed-bed as young seedlings are susceptible to competition. Traditional cultivation of pearl millet in Africa relies on rainfall to irrigate the plants and involves the application of little to no nitrogen fertilizers. The reason for this is often the application of nitrogen promoted vigorous early growth that can result in the plants using up water required at later stages of growth. In more temperate regions where pearl millet is grown as a forage crop, fertilizer application should be based on the results of a soil test.

### Harvesting

Pearl millet reaches maturity between 50 and 180 days after planting, depending on the variety. The crop is harvested by hand either by cutting the spikes from the plant or by cuting the whole plant.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Cercospora leaf spot Cercospora penniseti

- Symptoms: Small dark lesions on leaves which are usually oval in shape but may be oblong to rectangular; centers of lesions are gray to tan in color with visible black dots; lesions may be covered in spores during wet weather; lesions may also be present on the stems and are slightly longer than those on the leaves.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence occurs when high temperatures coincide with periods of high humidity.

- Management: Management Avoid planting millet varieties that are highly susceptible to Cercospora fungi; control weeds in field; rotate crops and practice good sanitation; no chemical control is needed to treat the disease.

#### Ergot Claviceps fusiformis

- Symptoms: Ergot is a disease of pearl millet grain-bearing heads (inflorescences). The first sign of ergot infection in pearl millet is the appearance of viscous creamy-pink exudations, called honeydew on the flowering heads. Subsequently hard brown spiky structures are formed, called sclerotia.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Ergot reduces grain yields and constitutes a health hazard to humans and animals that consume pearl millet products contaminated with the alkaloid- containing sclerotia of the causal fungus. It is a particularly serious disease of pearl millet F1 hybrids. Biology and Epidemiology: Infection of the individual florets on a pearl millet inflorescence occurs via the stigmas, i.e. the white feathery structures through which the florets are fertilised following pollination. Initial infection is from spores (ascospores) produced from sclerotia in the soil or in crop debris. Secondary infection is from the spores (conidia) produced in the honeydew. Once the stigmas have been pollinated they rapidly wither and are no longer available as the infection route for the ergot fungus. Pearl millet plants are protogynous, with the stigmas emerging before the anthers. Pearl millet F1 hybrids demonstrate synchronous flowering, so that most of the inflorescences in a crop will be at the protogynous stage with little or no pollen available, which makes F1 hybrids particularly vulnerable to ergot infection. Heavy rain at flowering time washes down pollen, extending the period at which the stigmas are available for infection as well as providing ideal conditions for germination and sporulation of the ergot fungus.

- Management: Management Ergot can be managed in pearl millet, through the use of host plant resistance, pollen management, avoidance and sanitation. Host plant resistance to ergot can be developed using appropriate inoculation, hybridisation and selection techniques. Sources of host plant resistance are developed and made available by public- and private-sector seed companies. It has been shown in research station experiments that using pollen donor plants to coincide with the protogynous stage of crop flowering can significantly reduce infection in ergot susceptible pearl millet F1 hybrids. Avoidance of ergot is achieved through the selection of cultivars that flower during periods of fine dry weather, so that pollen wash and pathogen germination are minimised. Sanitation measures involve the removal and burning of infected inflorescences as soon ergot symptoms are seen. When this is done at the honeydew stage it will reduce secondary spread within the crop. When done at the sclerotial stage it will reduce the inoculum bank for infections in subsequent seasons and reduce the dangers of consumption of the the poisonous alkaloids getting into food and feed products.

#### Pearl Millet Downy Mildew Sclerospora graminicola

- Symptoms: The earliest symptoms are chlorosis at the base of a leaf, with subsequent leaves on the plant becoming more and more chlorotic, with the chlorosis always extending from the bases towards the tips of the leaves. The underside of chlorotic leaves develop white powdery or downy growth of sporangia and the spores that they bear. There is a distinct margin between diseased leaf tissue at base of leaf and healthy tissue towards tip. Inflorescences of infected tillers develop the characteristic green-ear symptoms where the grain is replaced by whip-like vegetative structures. Inflorescences can be partially or fully converted to green-ear, depending on the time in inflorescence development at which the infection occurred. Partial green-ear always begins at the base of the inflorescence. Plants infected at an early stage of development, before tillering begins can be killed.

- Cause: Oomycete

### Oomycete

- Comments: Serious disease in Africa and India, occurs wherever millet is grown.

Serious disease in Africa and India, occurs wherever millet is grown.

- Management: Management The disease is systemic with the pathogen infecting the growing point of each tiller as the leaf and panicle tissues are being formed. Primary infection is from oospores which are long-lived in the soil. Secondary infection is from the spores produced by the sporangia on the undersides of infected leaves. Oospores are formed in necrotic infected plant material, which then contribute to the inoculum bank in the soil. To reduce infection rogue infected plants when found in the field; treat seeds with an appropriate systemic fungicide prior to planting and continue to spray the crop at least once every 25 days after sowing. Seed treatment Pearl millet downy mildew can be effectively controlled through the use of metalaxyl-based fungicide seed treatments. Application rates as low as 2 g a.i. per kg seed, using specially formulated seed-treatment products, can provide complete control of downy mildew even with highly susceptible hybrids. There is no value of subsequent foliar fungicide sprays following effective seed treatment. On-farm sanitation and selection In situations where resistant cultivars and seed treatments are not available, farming communities can reduce the incidence of downy mildew in pearl millet by on-farm sanitation practices and the selection of seed from robust downy mildew-free plants. Secondary spread of downy mildew within a crop is caused by the spores produced on diseased leaves, so removal of diseased plants or tillers at the first sign of disease should minimise secondary spread. Removal of diseased plants prior to inflorescence emergence, combined with selection of seed for the next season’s sowing from robust, downy mildew-free plants, should also reduce the level of susceptibility in the local cultivar gene pool developing a population of locally DM-resistant cultivars. Sanitation and selection will be more effective if done on a community basis rather than by individual farmers acting alone. The basis for effective on-farm actions is for farmers to fully understand the cause and epidemiology of the disease. Host Plant Resistance Pearl millet downy mildew is best managed by the use of resistant cultivars. Much has been learnt and done in the last 30 years to identify and utilise host plant resistance to this disease, through research done by ICRISAT in collaboration with National Agricultural Research Services (NARS) in India and other countries. In India, the existence of a strong and effective national agricultural research system together with effective public- and private-sector seed companies, has enabled the development and dissemination of a succession of cultivars and hybrids that have a high degree of resistance to downy mildew. The pathogen, however, is variable in its pathogenicity, so that cultivars or hybrids resistant to downy mildew in one region may not be resistant elsewhere. The greatest range of pathogenicity occurs in the Sahel zone of Africa, where the host and pathogen have co-evolved over a long period. Pearl millet hybrids developed for resistance to downy mildew in India have been highly susceptible when grown in the Sahel. Through the ICRISAT-NARS cooperative International Pearl Millet Downy Mildew Nursery program, sources of resistance have been identified that are effective throughout India and right across the African Sahel.

#### Rust Puccinia substriata

- Symptoms: Small yellow or white raised spots on upper and lower leaf surfaces; spots tend to be more numerous on lower leaf surface; spots enlarge and develop into red-brown pustules which may be surrounded by a yellow halo.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Spores can be spread via wind and survive in crop debris in the soil.

- Management: Management Plant resistant varieties of millet if rust is a persistent problem; avoid the use of overhead irrigation; do now plant millet in close proximity to eggplant or other Solanaceous crops; there are no recommended chemical controls for rust.

#### Smut Tolyposporium penicillariae Bref.

- Symptoms: Smut is a disease of pearl millet grain-bearing heads (inflorescences) that can significantly reduce grain yields, wherever the crop is grown. Infected florets develop as plump sacs or sori, initially green in colour and then turning dark brown or black as the sori mature. The sori are filled with black spores of the causal fungus, hence the name smut.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Biology and epidemiology: Individual florets are infected by air-borne spores of the causal fungus when the inflorescences are at the protogynous stage. i.e. when the stigmas have emerged before pollination has occurred. Mature spores released from the sori when the crop is threshed are mixed with seed from non-infected florets, and these are the source of infection for the subsequent crop.

- Management: Management Smut is best managed by the use of resistant cultivars.

### Disease Category: Other

#### Striga or Purple Witchweed [Orobanchaceae] Striga hermonthica

- Symptoms: Purple Witchweed is the most serious parasitic weed on pearl millet in Africa, causing severe crop losses to this and other crops in the Sahel region. In India Striga asiatica is the most common witchweed species, though here it is not regarded as a serious problem in pearl millet.

- Cause: Weed

- Comments: Biology & Epidemiology: Seeds of this parasitic plant remain dormant in the soil until exudates from roots of pearl millet plants (and other host species) stimulate their germination. Germ-tubes then invade the pearl millet roots, establishing a pathway for the extraction of moisture and nutrients from the pearl millet plant to enable the witchweed plants to develop and produce a crop of purple flowers. The flowers produce seed which add to the seed bank in the soil for parasitism of future crops.

- Management: Management The most effective management would be achieved by the use of host- plant resistance. In situations where there are no witchweed-resistant cultivars available, farming communities can reduce the levels of damage to the crop by: a) hand-pulling the witchweed plants as soon as they are visible, thereby reducing the loss of nutrients and moisture by the crop plants and preventing the addition of more witchweed seeds to the seed bank in the soil; b) the use of “trap” or “decoy” crops such as cowpea or soybean, possibly as an intercrop, which can stimulate germination of the witchweed seeds but are not parasitised, thus reducing the seed bank available for the pearl millet crop. In addition there are reports of control of witchweed by treating crop seeds with chemicals that prevent the germinating witchweed seeds from parasitising the crop plants. Where such seed treatments have been shown to be effective, are approved for use and are within the economic capabilities of the cultivator, they could be used as part of an integrated management program. Farming communities can also attempt to develop locally-effective resistant varieties by selection of seed from plants that appear to have not been parasitised. A combination of effective locally-available management methods is recommended in an integrated management program.


# Pecan

## Description

Pecan, Carya illinoinensis, is a large deciduous tree in the family Juglandaceae grown for its edible seeds (nuts). The pecan tree has a thick gray-brown trunk which can reach 2 m (6.6 ft) in diameter and a rounded canopy that spreads . The bark is ridged and has a scaly appearance. The twigs of the tree are red-brown in color and the foliage is dark green. The leaves are pinnately divided and composed of 9–17 oblong-lanceolate leaflets. Each leaflet has as serrated margin and a downward curving tip. The tree produces separate male and female catkins with the male producing pollen and the female developing into the fruit. The male catkin is slender and pendulous, measuring 22–50 cm (8.7–19.7 in) in length and the female catkins are much smaller and possess 3–6 flowers in a cluster. The fruit is an oval–oblong drupe containing a single seed surrounded by a thin shell. The outer husk (shuck) is green, turning brown-black when mature at which point it also splits open to release the nut. The edible kernel of the nut is light brown in color and ridged longitudinally. Pecan trees can reach a height of 40–50 m (131–164 ft) and can live for several hundred years in a wild state. Commercial trees usually have an economic lifespan of approximately 25 years. Pecan originates from the North America, specifically, the South.

## Uses

Pecan nuts are consumed fresh or after roasting as a snack food or may be used as an ingredient in baked goods or confectionBasic requirements

Pecan trees have a high water requirement and within their native range they are found growing in deep soils where their extensive roots can reach the water table or along river banks or streams. Pecan trees thrive in areas with long hot summers and cool winters. Trees can be grown in a range of soils but will grow optimally in a deep, well draining clay loam or sandy loam with a pH 6.0–7.5. Growing multiple pecan trees requires a great deal of space as the trees can reach a very large size.

## Propagation

Pecan trees can be propagated from nuts or by budding or grafting. Nuts for propagation should be collected in the Fall from trees which gave good fill. The seeds require stratification prior to planting. Stratification is the name given to a cold treatment which breaks the dormancy of the seed, speeding the germination process. Nuts are stratified at 2–5°C (35.6–41°F) for a period of 3- to 90 days and then incubated at room temperature. Nuts should be soaked in water for 24 hours prior to the treatment and kept moist throughout by mixing the nuts on moist vermiculite.  The nuts can be planted outdoors in late winter if they are planted in place. if growing the seedlings in containers it is best to wait to plant until all threat of frost has passed. Seedling or grafted trees should be planted in full sun to part shade although trees are sensitive to shading and care should be exercised to ensure that the trees are not too shaded. Trees should be spaced 9–10 m (30–35 ft) apart

General care and maintenance

Newly planted trees must be supplied with adequate moisture to meet their growing requirements in the first few years following planting. Trees must be supplied with 10 to 15 gallons of water weekly. This water can come from rainfall, irrigation, or a combination of both. Fertilization rates should ideally be based on the results of a soil test prior to planting but generally, 4 lbs of a complete fertilizer should be applied in a circular area around the base of the tree measuring 25 square feet. Fertilizer should never be placed directly in the planting hole as it can cause damage to the tree roots. A subsequent similar application in the summer should be enough to meet the growth requirements of the tree. The following year, apply 4 lbs of complete fertilizer per inch of tree diameter. Fertilizer should not be placed within 30.5 cm (12 in) of the trees trunk.

### Harvesting

Pecans should be harvested as soon as the nuts have reached maturity, when the shuck has lost its green color and has started to split. in commercial plantations, hydraulic shakers may be used to dislodge the nuts from the tree.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose Colletotrichum gloeosporoides

- Symptoms: Shiny, dark brown sunken lesions on green fruit which may coalesce to cover the whole fruit; may be pink colored fungal masses on lesions during wet weather; yield may be reduced

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters on tree; disease emergence favors warm temperatures and high rainfall

- Management: Management Disease can be controlled by regularly applying appropriate fungicides; mummified fruit and infected branches should be removed to reduce inoculum; avoid cover crops which are an alternative host for the fungus; plant anthracnose resistant varieties

#### Downy spot Pseudocercosporella caryigena

- Symptoms: Circular, pale yellow spots on lower surface of leaves; spots may be covered with fuzzy white growth during wet; lesions develop through leaves and become visible on upper leaf surface; lesions on upper leaf surface yellow-brown; leaflets may drop from tree; nut yield may be reduced die to defoliation

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus survives in infected leaves from previous season; disease occurs sporadically in Southeastern U.S. and is common in the U.S. state of Texas

- Management: Management Downy spot is controlled by the fungicides that are applied to protect against scab

#### Powdery mildew Phyllactinia guttata

- Symptoms: Small, powdery white spots on leaves and fruit; spots spread to cover entire leaf; small black fungal fruiting bodies may be visible in the white growth; young leaflets may crinkle as they mature

# Pepper, bell

## Description

Bell peppers, Capsicum annuum are a cultivar group of annual or perennial plants in the family Solanaceae grown for their edible fruits. Bell pepper plants are short bushes with woody stems that grow brightly colored fruits. The alternating leaves are elliptical, smooth edged, and come to a distinct point.  The plant produces white or purple bell-shaped flowers which are 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. Red, yellow, purple, or brown fruit are produced each season about 3-6 weeks after flowering. Pepper plants can grow 1 m (3.3 ft) tall and are usually grown as annuals in temperate regions for only one growing season. Bell pepper may be  referred to as red pepper, yellow pepper or green pepper and is believed to have originated in Central and South America.

## Uses

Bell peppers can be eaten fresh as a salad vegetable, or cooked in a variety of dishes.Basic requirements

Bell peppers are warm-season crops and grow best at temperatures between 18 and 30°C (65–86°F). They can be grown in many soil types although sandy soils warm faster in Spring and are good for early planting. The soil should have a pH between 6 and 7. Peppers will not tolerate water saturated soil and should be planted in a well draining soil or raised bed. Peppers should be planted in an area that receives full sun for most of the day.

### Sowing seeds

In most cases, pepper seeds should be started indoors 8–10 weeks before the last Spring frost. Pepper should only be direct seeded in areas with a long, warm growing season, otherwise seeds should be sown indoors in flats or cell trays using a sterile seedling mix. Plant seeds to a depth of 1.3 cm (1/2 in) and water lightly. Seeds should not be allowed to dry out as there will be a negative impact on germination rates.Trays should be positioned in a warm, bright, South facing window or under fluorescent lighting. The optimum soil temperature for germination is 21–29°C(70–85°F). A heat mat can be used to warm the flats if required. Seedlings will emerge within 8–25 days and after the seedlings has developed two sets of true leaves then they can be moved to a larger (3-4 in) pot. Seedlings should be provided with ample light and adequate fertilizer.

### Transplanting

Peppers are usually transplanted 2–3 weeks after the last frost when the soil temperature has reached a minimum of 15.5°C (60°F). Covering soil with dark plastic or mulch a week prior to planting outdoors can help bring the soil temperature up more quickly in colder regions, allowing earlier planting. Beginning approximately 7–10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/264). The hardening off process is very important as peppers are very susceptible to transplant shock. The planting site should be prepared by incorporating plenty of organic matter to encourage vegetative growth. When transplanting seedlings, allow 30–45 cm (12–18 in) between plants and 60–76 cm (24–30 in) between rows. Side dress plants with a nitrogen fertilizer at planting. Drip or soaker irrigation is preferred to overhead irrigation and plants should be watered evenly to keep them moist. Mulching around the plants can also help to conserve soil moisture.

General care and maintenance

Peppers will benefit from applications of fertilizer to keep them supplied with essential nutrients. A timed release fertilizer can be applied at bloom or the plants can be fed with a liquid fertilizer at planting and every two weeks thereafter. In addition, pepper plants can produce a heavy load of fruit and it can be helpful to provide the plants with some support using stakes or cages to prevent branches from breaking under the weight. Use a soft material to tie plants to stakes or cages.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose Colletotrichum spp.

- Symptoms: Circular lesions on fruit which contain tan to orange to black concentric rings in the center; lesions usually reach 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter but may enlarge to cover most of the fruit surface; lesions may also occur on leaves and stems and appear as irregularly shaped gray spots with dark margins

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Anthracnose is found in all major vegetable growing areas worldwide and can cause large losses if left untreated

- Management: Management Always plant disease-free seeds and transplants; seeds can be freed from infection by treating with hot water at 52°C (125.6°F) for 30 minutes; if disease is known to present, the field should be rotated with non-susceptible crops for a period of 3 years; plowing crop residue deeply into the soil r removing crop debris can help to reduce inoculum in the soil

#### Cercospora leaf spot (Frogeye leaf spot) Cercospora capsici

- Symptoms: Initial symptoms of infection are the formation of small, circular, water- soaked spots on leaves, stems, petioles and/or peduncles; the lesions mature to have white to brown centers surrounded by a brown to red or purple border; as the lesions expand, they may develop a water-soaked outer edge and dark outer ring which gives the lesions a concentric appearance; mature lesions are brittle and cracked in the center; lesions may be between 0.3 and 1.3 cm (0.1–0.5 in) in diameter;

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Cercospora leaf spot is mainly a disease of tropical and subtropical countries and occurs mainly in Africa, South America, Asia and the West Indies. In the U.S. it is found mainly in the southestern states

- Management: Management Apply appropriate fungicide if disease is severe

#### Southern blight Sclerotium rolfsii

- Symptoms: Sudden wilting of leaves; yellowing foliage; browning stem above and below soil; browning branches; stem may be covered with fan-like mycelial mat

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus can survive in soil for long periods; disease emergence favored by high temperatures, high humidity and acidic soil; disease found mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, including the southern United States

- Management: Management Remove infected plants; avoid overcrowding plants to promote air circulation; rotate crops with less susceptible plants; plow crop debris deep into soil; provide a barrier to infection by wrapping lower stems of plant with aluminum foil covering below ground portion of stem and 2-3 in above soil line

#### Verticillium wilt Verticillium spp.

- Symptoms: Initial symptoms of the disease include plants becoming stunted and lower leaves turning yellow; as the infection progresses, more leaves turn yellow and begin dropping from the plant; plants wilt during the day and recover at night; wilting becomes permanent and plant death ensues.

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Disease is present in pepper grown in Europe, Canada and the U.S.; the severity of the disease when it emerges is dependent on many factors, including the strain of the pathogen, host susceptibility, soil type and prevailing climatic conditions

- Management: Management There are currently no effective control strategies for Verticillium wilt once it is present in the field; cultural control practices should be employed to lessen the chances of the disease emerging in the first place; management strategies include rotating the crop every 3–4 years away from pepper; soil fumigation and/or solarization can reduce the level of inoculant in the soil

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial canker Clavibacter michiganensis

- Symptoms: Small, raised, white lesions on leaves that grow larger, turn brown and necrotic and may have a yellow halo; raised white lesions on fruit which coalesce to form larger spots, often with white halo

- Cause: Bacteria

- Comments: Most major losses in pepper crop are incurred in tropical and subtropical growing regions; disease also affects tomato, potato, tobacco and eggplant crops; bacteria enter the plants through tiny wounds in roots

- Management: Management Bacterial wilt is very difficult to control once it is established in a field; cultural control methods include planting disease-free seedlings and ensuring irrigation water is free of the pathogen; plants should not be irrigated excessively to prevent build-up of water which favors the development of the disease; pepper should be rotated with non-susceptible crops to prevent the build up of the pathogen in the soil

### Disease Category: Other

#### Blossom-end rot n/a

- Symptoms: Small water-soaked area on end of fruit where the blossom was occurring or on the side of unripe fruit; lesion enlarges and turns sunken, tan brown and leathery in appearance

- Cause: Low calcium concentration in fruit

- Comments: Physiological disorder; low calcium may result from competition from other ions in soil e.g. potassium; can also be caused by drought stress; fluctuations in soil moisture or application of excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer which promotes rapid vegetative growth

- Management: Management Maintain soil pH at 6.5; lime soil to increase the concentration of calcium in soil and decrease competition with other ions; use mulch to reduce drought stress; avoid ammonium fertilizers as they may increase competition with calcium by increasing ammonium ions in soil, use nitrate instead; avoid over fertilizing

#### Magnesium deficiency

- Symptoms: Symptoms of magnesium deficiency appear on older leaves first; initial symptoms are interveinal chlorosis of the leaves and, occasionally, a purple tinge to the leaves; as the deficiency becomes more severe, leaves may appear white with green veins; severe deficiencies may lead to reduced fruit yield

- Cause: Nutritional disorder

- Comments: Magnesium deficiency is rare in field grown peppers but can arise in sandy soils when heavy rain causes leaching

- Management: Management Magnesium deficiency can be prevented by applying dolomite lime to the soil, if an increase in soil pH is required, or through applications of a fertilizer containing magnesium

#### Nitrogen deficiency

- Symptoms: Plants exhibit reduced growth and leaves are smaller than normal; leaves exhibit a general yellowing; fruit are reduced in size and pale in color; older leaves of the plant show symptoms first and the yellowing progresses to younger leaves

- Cause: Nutritional disorder

- Comments: Nitrogen deficiency usually arises in cmmercial plantations through inadequate fertilizer application; heavy rain can leach nitrogen from sandy soils

- Management: Management If detected early, symptoms of nitrogen deficiency can be treated by applying appropriate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Mosaic Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Potato virus Y (PVY)

- Symptoms: Alternating light and green areas or mosaic patterns on the leaves; leaves distorted and curled; slow plant growth

# Pigeon pea

## Description

Pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan, is a perennial shrub in the family Fabaceae grown for its edible pods and seeds. Pigeonpea is a highly branched shrub with a woody base, slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant leaflets are oblong or elliptical in shape and the leaves are alternate and arranged spirally on the stems. The plant usually produces yellow flowers, but they can be yellow with streaks of purple or red.  The flowers are produced on racemes of 5–10 flowers. The seed pods are flat and either straight or sickle shaped and measure 5–9 cm (2–3.5 in) in length. Each pod can contain between 2 and 9 seeds which can be white, cream, brown, yellow, purple or black or mottled with any combination of these colors. Pigeonpea can reach 0.5–4.0 m (1.6–13.1 ft) in height and is usually grown as an annual, harvested after one season. It may also be referred to as red gram or congo pea and originates from India.

## Uses

Pigeon pea is one of the most important legumes grown in semi-arid tropical regions and young seeds are consumed fresh as a vegetable or can be allowed to mature before drying and eating as a pulse. The seed pods are also edible and are eaten as a vegetable. The leaves and seed husks of the plant can be used as an animal feed.Basic requirements

Pigeon pea grows best in hot humid climates where temperatures are between 18 and 38°C (64.4–100.4°F). The plants will grow in a wide range of soils, from sandy soil to clay and also in soils with low fertility. Pigeon pea will grow optimally in a well drained soil with a pH between 5.0 and 7.0. Once established, pigeon pea is relatively tolerant to drought conditions and can survive for long periods with little irrigation.

## Propagation

Pigeon pea is propagated directly from seed which should be sown in a prepared seed bed. Seeds should be planted to a depth of 2.5–10 cm (1–4 in) leaving 30–50 cm (12–20) between plants and 150 cm (60 in) between rows. Higher seeding rates should be used if the pant is being grown for use as a green manure. Pigeon pea is commonly intercropped with millets, cotton, sorghum or groundnut.

General care and maintenance

All weeds should be eliminated from the seed bed to prevent competition with the initially slow growing seedlings. Generally, pigeon pea does not require irrigation or fertilization. An application of phosphate at a rate of 20–100 kg per hectare is recommended and irrigation may be necessary if the plants are intensively grown.

### Harvesting

Pigeon pea is commonly harvested by hand. Machine harvesting by combine is possible if a variety is grown where pods ripen uniformly. The plant is cut at the ground when the majority of pods have reached maturity. The plants are air dried and then threshed to remove the seeds.

# Pineapple

## Description

Pineapple, Ananas comosus, is an herbaceous biennial or perennial plant in the family Bromeliaceae grown for its edible fruit. The pineapple plant has a short stout stem and a rosette of sword-shaped leaves with needle-like tips. The leaves are waxy, have upturned spines on the margins and may be soild green or striped with red, white or cream. When the plant flowers, the stem begins to elongate and produces a flower head of small purple or red flowers, each with a pointed bract. The stem continues to elongate and sets down a tuft of of short leaves called a 'crown'. Individual fruits develop from the flowers and fuse to form one large cylindrical fruit topped by the crown. This fruit, known as a pineapple, has a tough rind made up of hexagonal units and a fibrous, juicy flesh which may be yellow to white in color. Pineapple may reach 1.5–1.8 m (5–6 ft) in height and some varieties can grow for in excess of 20 years. Pineapple originates from the tropical regions of the Americas.

## Uses

Pineapple fruit is commonly eaten fresh or it may be cooked in a variety of dishes. Pineapple may also be canned or used to produce juice.Basic requirements

Pineapple is a tropical plant and grows best in temperatures between 23–32°C (73.4–89.6°F). The plant can tolerate colder temperatures for short periods but will be killed by frosts. Pineapple will grow optimally in well-draining sandy loam which is rich in organic matter. The optimum pH for pineapple growth is between 4.5–6.5. Established pineapple plants are tolerant of drought but will not tolerate waterlogged soil which quickly leads to root rot.

## Propagation

Pineapple is propagated from crowns, slips or suckers, with slips or suckers being the preferred method for commercial growers. Pineapple suckers arise from leaf axils, while slips grow from the stalk below the fruit. These are cut from the parent plant and used to produce new plantings. The cuttings are usually cured for a day or two prior to planting by sitting them in the shade.  Pineapple plantings are normally set out in double rows with the material staggered 25–30 cm (10–12 in) apart within the double row and allowing a further 60 cm (2 ft) between double rows.

General care and maintenance

Pineapples require supplemental irrigation during dry spells for optimum production. Mulching around the plants will help to conserve soil moisture. Ratooning may also be utilized as a means of encouraging growth. After the first crop of fruit, ratooning the plants will result in new fruit within 18 months. This process may be repeated a second or third time but then the crop will be rotated to prevent build up of disease. Removing suckers and slips from developing plants helps the plant to focus energy on growing the fruit and leads to larger fruit that develops quicker. Pineapples benefit from the application of additional nitrogen and potassium. Application rates depend largely on the type of soil the plants are growing in. Generally, little fertilizer is required during the first few months following planting but requirements increase rapidly in the period leading up to flower development. Fertilizers are usually applied as foliar sprays.

### Harvesting

Pineapples are ready to harvest when at least one third of the fruit rind has turned from green to yellow. Fruits are harvested by hand by cutting the crown and peduncle from the plant. The fruit will continue to ripen off of the plant.

## Common Pests and Diseases

- Management: Management Planting in raised beds helps to drain the soil and reduces incidence of the disease; mulch from pineapple debris should be avoided; pre- planting dips and foliar applications of Fosetyl Al are very effective at controlling the disease


# Pistachio

## Description

Pistachio, Pistacia vera, is a deciduous tree in the family Anacardiaceae grown for its edible seeds (nuts). Pistachio is a small to medium sized tree with a branching main stem (trunk) and a spreading growth habit. The leaves of the pistachio are pinnate and composed of five individual oval leaflets. Male and female inflorescences are produced on different trees (dioeceous).The flowers are small, brownish-green in color and lack petals. They are produced on panicles, each possessing several hundred flowers. The fruit of the tree is a drupe with an oblong kernel covered with a thin, bony shell. The shell splits along its long axes when mature. Pistachio trees can reach up to 20 ft (65.6 ft) in the wild but are generally smaller under cultivation. They reach maximum productivity in terms of fruit production after approximately 20 years and can live for several hundred years. Pistachio may also be referred to as green almond and originated from western Asia.

## Uses

Pistachio nuts are eaten as a snack food, usually after salting and roasting.Basic requirements

Pistachio trees grow best in areas with a long hot summer and cold winter as the tree has a chilling requirement. The tree is tolerant of frost and can withstand winter temperatures as low as -20°C (-4°F). Trees are also drought resistant and can be grown on a wide range of soils, including rocky or stony soils, without irrigation but trees will grow optimally in well draining, deep sandy loams. Pistachio trees are wind pollinated and require the planting of both male and female trees for successful pollination and fruit set.

## Propagation

General care and maintenance

Pistachios have a similar nitrogen requirement to other nut trees. Fertilizer should not be applied in the first year following planting but in the subsequent year, each tree should be supplied with 1 lb of ammonium sulfate split between two applications over the course of the growing season. In the years following, trees should be fertilized with actual nitrogen with application rates varying from 100 to 150 lb per acre. The nitrogen should be split evenly into two applications over the growing season. no nitrogen should be applied after June to prevent vigorous growth that may delay the tree entering dormancy, potentially leading to damage from early frosts.

### Harvesting

Newly budded pistachio trees will not begin to produce fruit for five years and will not reach maximum production until the twelfth year. Nuts are ready to harvest when the hull separates easily from the shell. This period extends for 7 to 10 days. If nuts are harvested before or after this critical period kernels may be underdeveloped and shells may become stained.

## Common Pests and Diseases

# Plantain

## Description

## Uses

Plantains are eaten as a vegetable and are cooked prior to consumption. They are an important component of many dishes in Western Africa and Caribbean countries. In addition, the leaves of Musa species can be used as a source of fibre for thread, cloth string, thread or can be used as thatch and roofing. The plants are also grown as an effective source of shade for other crops.Requirements

Plantains grow best in hot and humid climates, require a rainfall of at least 1000 mm (39.4 in) per year to survive and have a high light requirement. Plantains will grow optimally at 27°C (98.6°F) and require a deep soil, rich in organic matter which is well draining and well aerated. The plants will grow optimally in soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. Young plantains are very susceptible to wind damage and it is recommended that they are planted in sufficient shelter or in a block so that the plants will protect one another.

### Suckers

Plantains are vegetatively propagated, most often from suckers (shoots that grow from a bud at the base of the plant) or from corms (underground bulbs known as rhizomes). The use of whole corms is very laborious so it is more common to grow from small pieces of corm. There are three different types of banana suckers which are produced by the mother plant; maidenheads, sword suckers and water suckers. Maidenheads have a large pseudostem which does not produce fruit. Sword suckers have a narrow base, short pseudostem and narrow, blade-like leaves. They produce healthy, fruitful pseudostems when they mature Water suckers have short pseudostems and broad leaves. Water suckers are not strongly attached to the rhizome and generally produce weaker plants and less fruit. Maidenheads and large sword suckers are preferred over water suckers.

### Planting

The desired pieces of the plant are usually planted 30–60 cm (11.8–23.6 in) deep in the soil and should generally be planted at the end of the dry season or the beginning of the wet season.  Plant spacing is dependent on the cultivar being planted.  Frequent weeding is required until plants are tall enough to shade out competing plants and should be started about 6 weeks after planting.  Plantains are fast growing and require the frequent addition of nutrients as well as additional irrigation in the dry season. Plantain is often grown alongside other crop plants with similar requirements, indeed, the young banana plants make excellent 'nurses' for other crops such as papaya or cocoa which can be grown very close to the young plantains.

# Plum and prune

## Description

Plum, Prunus domestica, is a deciduous tree in the family Rosaceae grown for its edible fruits. The plum tree has an erect growing habit with a spreading canopy. It possesses large, thick, oval-shaped  leaves which are darker in color on the upper surface than on the lower and which often have a serrated edge.The tree produces buds on terminal spurs on the branches with each bud generally producing 3–5 flowers. The fruit is a fleshy oval fruit with a single seed contained within a stone. The color of the fruit varies with variety and fruits can be purple, blue, green, red or yellow. Plum trees can attain a height of between 6 and 10 m (20–33 ft) and can live for periods in excess of 50 years if properly maintained. Plum may also be referred to as European plum and originates from Southwest Asia

## Uses

Plum fruits are commonly consumed fresh or used to make jams or jellies. Plums may be dried to produce prunes.Basic requirements

Plums grow best in areas with warm summers and require a summer temperature between 20 and 30°C (68-86°F) for the fruit to mature. The trees also have a chilling requirement to break dormancy. Plum trees grow best in well-draining sandy loams in areas that receive full sun but can will grow in a variety of soils as long as water does not sit on the surface after heavy rainfall. It can be beneficial to plant the trees on elevated land to allow cold air to drain away. Trees will grow optimally in soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5

## Propagation

Plum trees are propagated vegetatively to maintain the desirable genetic characteristic of the parent. Plum rootstocks are commonly used but plum may also be grafted onto peach, Japanese apricot and almond rootstocks. Plum trees should be planted in full sun. Plant bare root trees in a pre-dug hole which is  slightly wider than the root ball. Backfill the hole so that the tree is planted to its original planting depth ensuring that the bud union is above the soil line. It is usually possible to identify this from changes in the color of the bark. If planting multiple trees they should be spaced 2.0–2.5 m (6.6–8.2 ft) apart. Most plum varieties are self fruitful but cross pollination may be required for fruit set. Plums are pollinated by honeybees and it can be beneficial to maintain bee hives in orchards.

General care and maintenance

Plums should be pruned annually, including the year of planting and are best trained to an open center. When the tree is bearing fruit, it is important to thin the fruits to prevent the tree from over-bearing. Aim to have 1 fruit every 15–20 cm (6–7 in). This allows fruits to become larger and prevents the tree from reducing production the following year. Trees should be watered regularly during the growing season to aid with fruit development. During dry periods, water trees every 10 to 14 days. Apply water deeply and widely, to at least the width of the canopy. Trees will also benefit from the application of a nitrogen fertilizer in Spring.

### Harvesting

Plum fruits should be allowed to mature on the tree. Fruits can be picked by hand when the skin has turned the color typical of the variety being grown.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Armillaria root rot Armillaria mellea

- Symptoms: If tree is infected after it has reached 5 years of age then typical symptoms include poor terminal growth and small leaves; around midsummer the whole tree suddenly collapses; in orchards trees usually die in a circular pattern; infected trees often have a fan-shaped white fungal mat growing between the bark and wood of the crown

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus survives in dead roots; symptoms similar to Phytophthora root rot; aqvoid planting plum in areas where oak has been planted recently

- Management: Management Once a tree is infected there is no treatment and it should be removed, fumigants do not control fungi in soil adequately; do not plant apricot in newly cleared forest or on the site of old orchards with a history of Armillaria

#### Black knot Apiosporina morbosa

- Symptoms: Elongated swellings (knots) on woody parts of tree which can reach up to 30 cm (12 in) long; knots are initially olive green in color with a corky texture but turn black in color and become hard and brittle; knots grow in length each year

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Infections occur on new shoots after rainfall and knots develop rapidly in second year

- Management: Management Prune knots on twigs and branches 8-10 cm (3-4 in) below the swelling and remove the pruned branches from the orchard; remove knots on older branches by removing the knot plus 2 cm (0.8 in) of surrounding tissue; removal of knots is most effective when done in midsummer; disease can be controlled by application of appropriate fungicides, if available, during shoot elongation

#### Brown rot Monolinia spp.

- Symptoms: Death of young blossoms and associated twigs and leaves; small tan cankers with dark margins on twigs; gummy exudate at base of flowers; brown spore masses on flowers in humid conditions; infected fruit usually exhibit a rapidly spreading brown rot but may also take the form of small necrotic spots; infected fruits usually remain attached to the tree

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Fungus survives in mummified fruit on the tree, blighted blossoms, cankers and infected twigs; blossom and twig blights are promoted by periods of wet weather

- Management: Management The currently most effective method of controlling brown rot is through the application of appropriate protective fungicides timed so that they are applied when the susceptible flower parts are exposed or after a wet period; avoiding sprinkler irrigation protects the leaves and flowers from wetness that promotes the disease. Cultural control methods include: removing mummified fruit from tree, pruning infected twigs and reducing plant stress by providing adequate levels of water and fertilizer

#### Powdery mildew Sphaerotheca pannosa Podosphaera tridactyla

- Symptoms: White powdery growth occuring in circular patches on fruit; scabby, dry patches on fruit; white powdery growth on leaves in Fall

- Cause: Fungi

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus overwinters in twigs or in leaves which remain attached to the tree

- Management: Management Rust can be prevented by spraying trees with protective fungicides; application is usually carried out one, two and three months before harvest in areas prone to early season outbreaks of the disease and after harvest in areas where disease is less problematic or emerges later in the season

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial canker Pseudomonas syringae

- Symptoms: Cankers on twigs at bases of flower and leaf buds, in pruning wounds or at the base of spurs which exude amber colored gum; cankers spread upwards and form sunken areas in winter; if pathogen enters dormant buds they may be killed or open normally in Spring before collapsing in early Summer; infected buds may be symptomless

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Bacteria are spread by water splash; disease emergence favored by high humidity and low temperatures in spring

- Management: Management Ensure that a suitable plum variety and rootstock is chosen based on geographic location and environmental conditions to prevent stress to tree which predisposes tree to canker disease; apply protective copper spray to trees before flowering; prune trees in early summer to decrease likelihood of infection

#### Bacterial spot Xanthomonas campestris

- Symptoms: Water soaked, angular gray lesions on the underside of the leaves which turn purple and necrotic in the center and cause a shot hole appearance if lesion center drops out; if lesions are present in high numbers on leaves they may become chlorotic and drop from tree; cankers develop on twigs either as raised blisters or as a dark area surrounding a bud that fails to open; in years of severe infection the entire fruit crop may be lost; lesions on fruit begin as small brown, water-soaked lesions which may exude gum

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Periods of frequent rainfall during late bloom and early petal drop increase likelihood of fruit and leaf infection; infection is rare during hot, dry weather

- Management: Management Avoid planting susceptible varieties in areas where disease is known; once disease is visible it can be difficult to control, protective copper applications in the Fall prior to leaf drop and/or application in early growing season may help prevent the disease; care should be taken as peach trees are very sensitive to copper

#### Crown gall Agrobacterium tumefaciens

- Symptoms: Galls on root and/or crown of tree which can range in size from so small they are not visible to the naked eye up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter; galls first become visible as white, fleshy swellings that grow rapidly and become tan to brown in color; galls typically develop at the site of a wound and new galls form adjacent to old ones the next year

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Infection with crown gall begins at the site of plant wounds; disease emergence is favored by poorly-drained, alkaline soils and previous feeding damage by nematodes

- Management: Management Chemical control of the disease is generally ineffective; an effective bacterial biological control is available for commercial production; cultural control methods include: planting only certified, disease-free material, planting plum in well-draining soil, rotating infected fields with a non-host before plum is planted and also using good sanitation practices

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Phytophthora root and crown rot Phytophthora spp.

- Symptoms: Poor new growth; leaves chlorotic, small in size and sparse; fruit may be small, brightly colored and susceptible to sunburn; shoots may suffer from dieback and tree will often die within weeks or months of first signs of infection or decline gradually over several seasons; root crown may show signs of decay which develops into a canker; bark of infected crown tissue turns dark brown; cankers may occur on aerial parts of plant

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Severity of disease is linked to soil moisture content; water-saturated soils promote development of fungus

- Management: Management Plant certified healthy material; remove infected trees from orchard; chemical sprays to control aphids may prolong spread of virus


# Pomegranate

## Description

Pomegranate, Punica granatum, is a deciduous or evergreen tree or shrub in the family Punicaceae grown for  its edible fruits. The pomegranate tree is branched and spiny with glossy, leathery, oval to oblong leaves that grow in whorls of five or more on the branches. The tree produces bright red flowers singly at the tips of the branches and a rounded hexagonal fruit with a thick pink-red skin. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind which protects the pulp[ and seeds inside. The inside of the fruit is separated into compartments by white spongy tissue. Each compartment contains seeds and pulp. Each pomegranate fruit may contain as many as 600 seeds. Pomegranate trees can reach a height of 10 m (33 ft) and can be very long lived, although their economic lifespan is usually between 12 and 15 years. Pomegranate may also be referred to as grenadine or Chinese apple and originated from Central Asia, likely in Iran.

## Uses

Pomegranate is primarily eaten as a fresh fruit by splitting open the rind and consuming the seeds. The seeds may be used in salads. The fruit may also be used to produce juice, either by removing and pressing the seeds or by pressing the whole fruit.Basic requirements

Pomegranates grow best in temperate or semi-arid climates with a cool winter and warm summer. They are less hardy than many other deciduous fruit trees but more hardy than citrus. Pomegranates will suffer severe damage when temperatures drop below -10°C (14°F). Pomegranate can be grown successfully on a range of soil types, including calcareous soils and acidic loam but will grow optimally in deep, well-draining loam.

## Propagation

Commercial pomegranate trees are propagated from softwood and hardwood cuttings as seeds will not breed true to type. Hardwood cutting are generally preferred over softwood due to the ease with which they root. Hardwood cuttings are taken from shoots or suckers from the previous season and are rooted in nursery beds after treatment with a rooting hormone. Cuttings are grown in the nursery for one season before being planted out in the orchard. Rooted cuttings are best planted in winter or early spring and are usually spaced 3.5–5.5 m (11.5–18 ft) apart. The young trees are headed back to a height of 60–70 cm (23–28 in) after planting to promote branching.

General care and maintenance

Pomegranates have a similar water requirement to citrus trees and should be provided with additional irrigation during dry periods. Pomegranate orchards usually utilize drip, furrow or sprinkler irrigation systems to promote optimal yields. Pomegranates can be pruned to a single stemmed tree or allowed to grow as a multi-stemmed bush. Suckers should be removed from around the central trunks as they develop. Pomegranates will benefit from the addition of nitrogen. Nitrogen should be applied at a rate of 0.2–0.5 kg per tree each year. Pomegranate fruits are usually thinned to promote the production of larger fruits

### Harvesting

Pomegranate fruits are generally ready to harvest between 6 and 7 months after flowering, fruits should be allowed to mature fully on the branch prior to harvest as they will not continue to ripen off of the tree. Fully mature fruit turn bright red in color and make a metallic sound when tapped. Fruits should be harvested by cutting from the tree.

## Common Pests and Diseases

# Potato

## Description

The potato ( Solanum tuberosum ) is a widely cultivated root vegetable in the Solanaceae family. They are native to the Andes Mountains in South America and have been grown for thousands of years. Potatoes are a staple food in many countries around the world and are used in a wide variety of dishes. They are high in carbohydrates, fiber, and vitamins C and B6.

Potatoes are typically planted in the spring and harvested in the late summer or early fall. They grow best in well-drained soils with a pH between 4.5 and 7.5. Potatoes require a lot of water, especially during the flowering and fruiting stages, and they are sensitive to frost.

The crop can be propagated from seed potatoes, which are small tubers that are planted in the soil. They can also be propagated from potato seed, which is a less common method. Once the seed potato or seed is planted, the plant will grow leaves and flowers, and then it will produce tubers underground.

The potato is a herbaceous perennial plant grown for its edible tubers. The plant has a branched stem and leaves consisting of leaflets that are both unequal in size and shape and can be oval to oblong in shape. The leaves can reach up to 10–30 cm in length. Tubers grow about 25 cm underground in the soil and can be yellow, red, or purple depending on the variety. The potato plant produces white or blue flowers and yellow-green berries. The plants can go up to 1m (3.3ft) in height.

Potatoes are grown in many countries across Africa, but the main potato- producing countries are Egypt, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Kenya. In these countries, potatoes are grown both for local consumption and for export.

Potatoes are a relatively new crop in Africa, having been introduced to the continent in the late 19th century. However, since then, potato production has increased significantly, with farmers in Africa recognizing the potential of the crop as a food security and income generation opportunity.

Potatoes grow well in the cool highland regions of Africa, where the temperature and rainfall are suitable for the crop. However, potato cultivation in Africa is often challenged by a lack of access to quality seed potatoes, a lack of irrigation systems, and the prevalence of pests and diseases.

FAOSTAT reports that production of potatoes in Africa has more than doubled, with eastern Africa producing the biggest yield. The crop is primarily produced by small-holder farmers, with Algeria leading in production with 4,928,028 tons per year, overtaking Egypt, which produces 4,800,000 tons per year.

The following is a summary of the physical attributes of potato crops:

### Crop Details

## Uses & Benefits

Potato tubers are a staple food source in temperate regions and are eaten after cooking. They may be cut or sliced and made into potato chips or fries. Potatoes can also be processed into starch, alcohol or flour.

Potatoes are a good source of carbohydrates, potassium, and vitamin C; they are also a source of fiber, vitamin B6, and folate. They are low in fat, calories, and sodium.

The values shown in the following table are approximate and may vary depending on the variety, growing conditions, and preparation method of the potatoes. Additionally, cooking and processing methods such as frying or mashing can change the nutritional value of potatoes and increase their calorie and fat content.

## Varieties

Potatoes are grown in many countries across Africa, and different varieties are grown depending on the region and the local market. For example, in Egypt, the most common variety grown is Desiree, which is a red-skinned variety with a waxy texture that is good for boiling and mashing. In South Africa, farmers grow varieties such as "Bintje," "Sifra," and "Agria," which are known for their high yields and good storage capabilities. In Ethiopia, farmers grow varieties such as "Sarpo Mira," which is known for its resistance to pests and diseases, and "Shepody," which is known for its good taste and texture. In Kenya, farmers grow varieties such as "Kenya Mpya," “Shangi”, and "Kenya Raha," which are known for their high yields and good taste.

It's worth noting that Africa has a rich diversity of local varieties of potatoes known as "landraces." These varieties have been developed and adapted to the local conditions and have the potential to provide food security and income for the farmers. However, the use of improved varieties and the adoption of good agricultural practices are necessary to achieve the full potential of potato production in Africa.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Potatoes are a cool-season crop that grows best in certain climatic, soil, and water conditions.

Potatoes prefer a cool climate with moderate temperatures and a long growing season. They grow best at temperatures between 10–15 °C (50–59 °F) during the day and 5–10 °C (41–50 °F) during the night. Potatoes are sensitive to frost, and temperatures below 0°C (32°F) can damage the tubers. Potatoes also require a moderate-to-high amount of rainfall or irrigation.

They grow best in well-drained soils that are rich in organic matter and have a pH between 4.5 and 7.5. They prefer soils that are high in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and also require adequate levels of calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Potatoes also grow well in sandy loam or clay soils.

Potatoes require a lot of water, especially during the flowering and fruiting stages. They need about 1-2 inches of water per week, and more in hot and dry weather. They prefer consistent moisture throughout the growing season but also require good drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Potatoes are sensitive to drought and water stress, which can cause reduced yields and lower-quality tubers.

It's worth noting that while these are the ideal conditions for growing potatoes, the crop can be grown in a wide range of conditions, and some varieties are more tolerant to different conditions than others. Additionally, agronomic practices such as fertilization, irrigation, and crop rotation can help to improve the growth and yields of potatoes in challenging environments.

### Growing from Seed

The planting procedure for potatoes generally includes the following steps:

Preparing the soil: The soil should be well-drained and have a pH between 4.5-7.5. Prior to planting, the soil should be worked to a fine tilth, and any necessary amendments such as fertilizer or lime should be added.

Choosing seed potatoes: Seed potatoes should be disease-free and certified. They should be cut into pieces with at least one "eye" per piece, and should be left to dry for a few days before planting to allow the cuts to heal over.

Determining the planting date: The best time to plant potatoes will depend on your climate and the variety you are growing. Potatoes are typically planted in the spring, after the last frost date, and when the soil has warmed up to around 10-15°C (50-59°F).

Planting the seed potatoes: Seed potatoes should be planted at a depth of around 10-15 cm, with the "eyes" facing upward. They should be spaced around 30-40 cm apart, in rows that are 75-90 cm apart.

Watering and mulching: After planting, the soil should be watered well to settle the soil around the seed potatoes and to encourage germination. A layer of mulch, such as straw or grass clippings, can be applied to help retain moisture and suppress weeds.

### General Care and Maintenance

As the plants grow, they will require regular watering, fertilization, and weeding. The plants should be hilled up (soil should be added to the base of the plant) as they grow to prevent the tubers from being exposed to sunlight, which can cause them to turn green and become inedible.

### Harvesting

Harvesting potatoes is the process of collecting the tubers, which are the edible part of the potato plant, from the soil. The timing of the harvest is crucial and will depend on the variety of potato being grown. Generally, potatoes are ready to be harvested when the foliage has died back and the skin of the tubers has hardened.

Before harvesting, farmers need to check the tubers for maturity. This can be done by gently digging up a few plants and checking the size and skin of the tubers. The tubers should be fully formed, and the skin should be tough enough that it can't be easily scraped off with your fingernail.

When it comes to the actual harvesting process, farmers should be careful not to damage the tubers. They should be carefully dug up using a spade or potato fork, taking care not to damage the tubers. It's better to harvest when the soil is dry and not wet. After harvesting, the tubers should be placed in a warm, dark, and well-ventilated place for a week or two to "cure" (harden the skin) before being stored.

After curing, the tubers should be cleaned of any dirt and debris, and any damaged or diseased tubers should be removed and discarded. Potatoes should be stored in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated place with a temperature between 4 and 8 °C (39 and 46 °F) and a relative humidity of 90 to 95 %.

It's important to harvest potatoes at the right time to ensure the best quality and storage potential. Overripe potatoes have a higher chance of spoilage and can't be stored as long as mature ones. Additionally, it's also important to properly cure, clean, and store the tubers to ensure they maintain their freshness and quality for as long as possible.

# Pumpkin

## Description

Pumpkin is the name given to a group of plant species in the genus Cucurbita, including Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita mixta, Cucurbita maxima, and Cucurbita moschata. It is grown primarily as a vegetable or ornamental plant.

Pumpkins have long-running, bristled stems, large deeply-lobed leaves often containing white blotches, and yellow or orange flowers separated into male and female types on the same plant. The fruit is variable in shape and color but is often white, cream, or green, containing about 70% flesh and several large white seeds.

Pumpkin plants are short-lived annual or perennial vines with branching tendrils and broad lobed leaves. The plant produces large yellow or orange flowers and a pepo fruit (berry with a thick rind) known as a pumpkin. The fruit can range greatly in size, from miniature pumpkins weighing a few ounces to giant pumpkins which can reach over 75 lbs (34 kg). The skin of the pumpkin is usually ribbed and is usually orange in color although some varieties are green, grey, yellow, or red. Pumpkin plants are usually grown as annuals, surviving one growing season and the vines are capable of reaching 15 m (50 ft) in length if vines are allowed to root. Pumpkin may also be referred to as squash or marrow and is believed to have originated in Mexico and South America.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Cucurbita spp. (Cucurbita maxima, Cucurbita moschata etc.)

Common Name: Budho (Luo), Malenge (Kiwahili), Lisiebebe (Luhya), Marenge (Kikuyu), Risoa (Kisii), Ulenge (Kamba)

## Uses & Benefits

Pumpkin flesh, leaves, and flowers can be cooked and eaten in a variety of dishes. The seeds are also edible and are commonly roasted and eaten as a snack.

Ornamental gourds are cultivars of C. pepo with small, bitter, and inedible fruits in many shapes, sizes, and colors.

The pumpkin has been used as a medicine in Central and North America. It is a gentle and safe remedy for several complaints. The seeds are widely used as an anthelmintic. The complete seed, together with the husk, is used to remove tapeworms.

The fruit and seed decoctions have been reported to be used as diuretics and to reduce fevers, and are used for curing indigestion. The pulp is applied to burns and scalds, inflammation, abscesses, and boils. It is also used in the treatment of migraine and neuralgia.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Pumpkins and squashes (various Cucurbita spp.) are grown in the tropics from the lowlands up to 2500 m altitude. They are warm-season crops adapted to monthly mean temperatures of 18-27°C. C. maxima is the most tolerant of low temperatures, C. moschata and C. argyrosperma the least, with C. pepo intermediate. C. maxima and C. pepo have long been cultivated in temperate regions. Butternut appreciates part shade in very hot conditions, such as can be obtained when intercropped with other crops or grown under fruit trees.

Pumpkins and squashes respond very well to medium to heavy applications of compost or well-decomposed manure. They can be cultivated on almost any fertile, well-drained soil with a neutral or slight acid reaction (pH 5.5 to 7). They are drought-tolerant, require relatively little water, and are sensitive to waterlogging. Excessive humidity is harmful because of the development of leaf diseases, so none of the species do well in the humid tropics.

### Growing from Seed

Pumpkins and squashes are grown from seed. Seeds may be sown in containers and transplanted to the field when they are 10 cm high. Direct seeding of 2 to 3 seeds per hill is commonly practiced. Trailing types are planted at distances of 2-3 m either way; the seed requirement is 2 to 3 kg/ha. The bushy types (mainly C. pepo) are planted closer, for example, plants spaced 60 to 120 cm in rows 1 to 1.5 m apart; the seed requirement is 3 kg/ha for pumpkin and 7 kg/ha for summer squash (C. pepo). Do not use seeds from plants where edible pumpkins and ornamental gourds are grown close together. Offspring will be bitter or even inedible.

### General Care and Maintenance

Sole cropping is sometimes used for commercial production. Pumpkins and squashes are also planted in home gardens or mixed with field crops such as maize. Cultural practices to improve growth and development include the removal of growing tips (in trailing varieties) to check growth, and the bagging of fruits in paper to protect against fruit flies and other pests. Fruit sets may be stimulated by manual pollination. The fruit may rot when in contact with moist soil, so often cut grass or leaves are placed beneath the fruit.

### Harvesting

Winter squashes and pumpkins are picked when mature in a once-over harvest or in several rounds, about 90 to 120 days after planting depending on the variety. Pumpkins are considered to be among the most efficient vegetable crops when evaluated on nutritional yield land area and labor needed. Indicative figures for the seed yield of C. pepo are 400 to 1500 kg/ha. A valuable source of oil and protein is thus neglected if the seeds are left unutilized. In seed production, isolation between fields of different Cucurbita species is recommended, not only for the reason of purity but also for obtaining maximum yields (pollen of other species may cause reduced fruit set).

# Quince

## Description

Quince, Cydonia oblonga, is a bush-like deciduous tree in the family Rosaceae grown for its edible fruits. The tree has crowded, gnarled branches and a crooked growth habit. The leaves have a smooth upper surface and hairy lower surface. The tree produces single white-light pink colored flowers on tiny shoots and a large, fragrant, pome fruit. The fruit is initially covered in dense gray-white hairs but these disappear as the fruit ripens. The ripe fruit is a golden yellow color and resembles a pear or apple depending on variety. It has a soft, yellow pulp with a grainy texture protected by a thin skin. Quince trees can reach heights of 5–8 m (16–26 ft) and can live for periods in excess of 50 years and have an economic lifespan of approximately 25 years. Quince originates from Asia Minor.

## Uses

Quince fruits are consumed fresh or may be used to make jams and jellies.Basic requirements

Quince trees grow well in a wide range of climates and soils but the plants shallow root system make it susceptible to drought or a low availability of water and additional irrigation may be required. Quince should be planted in full sun and will grow optimally at temperatures averaging 15°C (59°F). Quince trees are more tolerant of wet soils and drought than apple trees and, compared with other fruit trees, has good cold tolerance, being hardy to temperatures between -15 and -25°C (5 and -13°F respectively). Quince trees are easily damaged by strong winds and should be planted in a sheltered location which will also protect them from rapid temperature fluctuations which is also detrimental to their growth.

## Propagation

Quince trees are usually propagated from hardwood cuttings or by budding onto a quince rootstock. Seeds can be grown but will not breed true to type and should not be used for commercial purposes where fruit quality is very important. Some varieties are not self compatible and require another variety for successful pollination and fruit production. Quince trees should be spaced 5–6 m apart (16–20 ft) apart, allowing 4–5 m (13–16 ft) between rows.

General care and maintenance

Quince trees are susceptible to fire blight and should not be fertilized excessively with nitrogen as this promotes vegetative growth which makes the trees more susceptible to the bacterium. Suckers should be removed by pruning from the tree in winter or early spring. Trees should be pruned in winter to thin out fruiting wood and stimulate new growth. If fruiting wood is pruned properly then fruits should not require thinning when the trees are bearing. Quince will benefit from regular deep watering during the summer months.

### Harvesting

Quince fruits should be harvested when they are mature but not full ripe. Fruits will continue to ripen off of the tree and by harvesting in this manner, losses from fruit dropping from the tree are reduced. Fruit should be cut from the tree using a sharp knife as pulling them can cause damage to the skin.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Brown rot Monolinia spp.

- Symptoms: Death of young blossoms and associated twigs and leaves; small tan cankers with dark margins on twigs; gummy exudate at base of flowers; brown spore masses on flowers in humid conditions; infected fruit usually exhibit a rapidly spreading brown rot but may also take the form of small necrotic spots; infected fruits usually remain attached to the tree

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Fungus survives in mummified fruit on the tree, blighted blossoms, cankers and infected twigs; blossom and twig blights are promoted by periods of wet weather

- Management: Management The currently most effective method of controlling brown rot is through the application of appropriate protective fungicides timed so that they are applied when the susceptible flower parts are exposed or after a wet period; avoiding sprinkler irrigation protects the leaves and flowers from wetness that promotes the disease. Cultural control methods include: removing mummified fruit from tree, pruning infected twigs and reducing plant stress by providing adequate levels of water and fertilizer

#### Leaf blight (Leaf fleck) Diplocarpon maculatum

- Symptoms: Dark red spots on leaves; brown spots on leaves; leaves dropping from plant; small, raised purple spots with white centre on leaves; dark brown spots on leaves; no fruit produced; tree defoliation

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Bacterium overwinters in bark or cankers; spread by pollinating insects and by rain splash

- Management: Management Cut out diseased wood; treat with Bordeaux mixture or approved fixed copper materials for organic production; streptomycin or copper application to blossoms may be necessary to prevent spread


# Radish

## Description

Radish, Raphanus sativus, is an herbaceous annual or biennial plant in the family Brassicaceae, grown for its edible taproot. The radish plant has a short hairy stem and a rosette (ground level horizontal and circular leaves) of oblong shaped leaves which measure 5–30 cm (2–12 in) in length. The top leaves of the plant are smaller and lance-like. The taproot of the plant is cylindrical or tapering and commonly red or white in color. The radish plant produces multiple purple or pink flowers on racemes which produce 2–12 seeds. The reddish brown seeds are oval, and slightly flattened. Radish is generally grown as an annual plant, surviving only one growing season and can reach 20–100 cm (8–39 in) in height depending on the variety. Radish may also be referred to by the name of the cultivar and names may include Chinese radish, Japanese radish or oriental radish. The origin of the radish plant has not been determined but they are found growing native from the Mediterranean to the Caspian Sea.

## Uses

The radish root can be eaten fresh in salads or cooked with other ingredients such as meat. The leaves of the plant are also edible and can bu used as a salad green.Basic requirements

Radishes are fast growing cool-season vegetables that grow very well in cool moist climates. the optimum temperature for the growth of radishes is between 10 and 18°C (50–65°F) and they grow best in a well-draining sandy loams which are rich in organic matter with a pH between 5.8 and 6.8.. Radish should be grown in full sun to part shade.

## Propagation

Radish is propagated directly from seed into a prepared bed. Seeds should be planted in late winter to early spring for the first spring crop and plantings can be staggered to provide a continuous harvest. A small amount of nitrogen may be applied to the soil prior to planting (up to 60 kg per hectare). Seeds should be planted at a depth of 1 cm (0.5 in), allowing 2.5 cm (1 in) between individual plants and a further 30 cm (12 in) between rows. Commercial producers may drill seeds using planting rates of 30–40 kg per hectare.

General care and maintenance

Radishes will benefit from the addition of small amounts of nitrogen fertilizer at regular intervals spaced over the growing season. Seedlings should be kept uniformly moist as they develop, but not wet. Weeds should be carefully removed from around the plants.

### Harvesting

Radishes usually reach full maturity between 30 to 50 days after sowing. They should be harvested promptly as over-mature radishes become woody and develop a bitter taste. The plants may be topped by cutting back the leaves to a height of 7–10 cm (2.8–3.9 in) prior to harvesting, or whole plants can be pulled from the soil. Roots should be washed prior to storing to increase longevity.

# Rapeseed (colza)

## Description

Rapeseed, Brassica napus, is an herbaceous annual or biennial member of the family Brassicaceae primarily grown for the oil which can be extracted from its seeds. The rapeseed plant has several erect, branched stems originating from a single base, the stems are purple in color towards the base. The leaves of the plant are bluish-green and mostly smooth. The basal leaves are stalked whereas the highest leaves grow straight off of the stem. The plant produces pale to bright yellow flowers which are 11–15 mm (0.4–0.6 in) in diameter, and after pollination the plant develops pods containing a single row of seeds. Each pod can contain 20–40 dark brown to black seeds. The rapeseed plant can reach 1.0–2.5 m (3.3–8.2 ft) and is grown as an annual, harvested after one growing season.  Rapeseed may also be referred to as colza, oilseed rape, canola, swede rape or fodder rape and is believed to originate from the Mediterranean.

## Uses

The seeds of the plant are used to extract rapeseed oil which can be used as a cooking oil or in the production of margarine. Some recently developed cultivars have a high erucic acid content which is extracted for the production of industrial oil.  Rapeseed is also grown as fodder for livestock.Basic requirements

Rapeseed is adapted to grow in cool, moist climates, requiring a temperature range of  2–10°C (35.6–56°F), although temperatures closer to 10°C (56°F) promote the most rapid growth. As a result, rapeseed is grown as a cool season crop in sub-tropical regions and a winter crop in more temperate areas. Rapeseed can be grown on a variety of soil types but medium textured, well-draining soils work best. Rapeseed should be grown in soil with a pH between 5.5 and 8.3. Rapeseed should not be grown in soil in which other brassicas have been grown within the past 3–4 years.

## Propagation

Rapeseed in almost always propagated from seed which is sown in prepared fields by drilling in rows. Seeds are sown shallowly as the seeds are very small and seed should be sown at a depth of 2–3 cm (0.8–1.2 in). Spring crops of rapeseed should be drilled in rows 18–23 cm (7–9 in) apart, whereas winter crops require more space and should be drilled in rows approximately 40 cm (16 in) apart.

General care and maintenance

It is important to control weed growth in rapeseed fields as they can have a significant impact on the growth and productivity of the crop. Good preparation of the seedbed helps to limit weed growth. This is achieved by tilling the soil in the fall prior to planting, followed by shallow cultivation just prior to seeding. Rapeseed has a high nutrient requirement and a soil test should be carried out prior to planting in order to prevent nutrient deficiencies from occurring. fertilizers are most successfully applied to the side of the seed furrows to prevent damage to the plants. Nitrogen fertilizer should be applied at a basic rate of 50–60 kg per hectare for spring planted rapeseed and 70 kg per hectare for winter crops. Fertilizer is commonly applied at time of sowing. in addition to nitrogen, rapeseed may also require the addition of phosphorus, potassium, sulfur and magnesium to the soil. The rate of application of these nutrients should be determined by a soil test.

### Harvesting

Rapeseed is a fast-ripening plant and is ready for harvest when the seeds have turned from green to black in color. Rapeseed is mechanically harvested by combine or by swathing. in some countries, such as China, the crop is cut by hand.

# Raspberry

## Description

Raspberry is the name given to two plant species in the genus Rubus, Rubus idaeus (red raspberry) and Rubus occidentalis (black raspberry) grown for their edible fruit. Raspberry plants have perennial root systems and biennial stems which are known as canes. The canes are woody, erect and shrub-like and generally undergo a period of growth one year and fruit production the next although primocane varieties exist that produce fruit in the first year. The canes may possess spines. Raspberry plants produce white or pink flowers with five petals which are surrounded by green sepals. After the plant has been pollinated, an aggregate berry is produced which consists of numerous druplets which are held together into the familiar raspberry fruit by tiny hairs.  Raspberry canes can grow from 0.5 to in excess of 2 m (1.6–6.6 ft) in height and red raspberry will produce a commercial yield of fruit for 16–20 years, while black raspberry has a shorter lifespan and will produce for 4–8 years.  Red raspberry may also be referred to as European raspberry, red garden raspberry or hindberry, while black raspberry may be referred to as blackcap raspberry and may have originated in the Ide mountains of Turkey.

## Uses

Raspberries are primarily consumed as a fresh fruit or may be processed into jams, jellies, juices and pulp.Requirements

Raspberry plants grow best in regions with cool summers and relatively mild winters. The plants are sensitive to high temperatures and grow best when daytime temperatures are around 25°C (77°F). Raspberries are best suited to well-draining sandy loams, rich in organic matter and have a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. Drainage it critical in raspberry propagation as the plants are susceptible to root rot. Plants require full sunlight and should not be planted in low lying areas where water may build up. Raspberries also require a post support system or trellis  to support the weight of the fruit on the canes. Raspberry canes are biennial and produce fruit in the second year of growth. Canes in their first year of growth are called primocanes and those in the second year of growth are called fruiting canes or floricanes. The young canes are green in color, whereas the older floricanes are tougher and have a woody covering making them easy to tell apart.

### Preparation

Soil may need prepared up to two years in advance of planting if major amendments are required. Acidic soil can be amended with lime to bring the pH up to a level suitable for raspberries. Organic content can be increased by planting a cover crop or by the addition of manure or compost. Avoid planting raspberries where peppers, eggplant, tomatoes or potatoes have been grown previously as these plants are host to Verticillium fungi which can cause root rot in raspberries. Choose a raspberry variety which is suited to your region. Red raspberries tend to be the most cold hardy, whereas black or yellow varieties are more sensitive.

Planting and trellising

Many raspberry varieties are very vigorous and using a support system such as a trellis will help to protect the canes from wind damage while also supporting the weight of the fruit crop. The trellis should be constructed before or at planting to avoid damaging the young plants after they are in the ground. The traditional method of supporting red raspberry canes is a post and wire system. This method involves running two wires about 60 cm (2 ft) apart vertically between wooden posts staked into the ground. The lower wire should be positioned 90 cm (3 ft) from the ground and the upper 1.5 m (5 ft) from the ground. The raspberry canes can then be tied to the wires. A second option is a T-trellis which is similar to the post and wire but the vertical wooden posts each have two cross bars to attach the wire. Two sets of wires run parallel to one another, one above the other. The vertical posts should be spaced 3.6–4.6 m (12-15 ft) apart with the lower wire positioned 90 cm (3 ft) from the ground and the upper 1.5 m (5 ft) from the ground. Raspberry plants in the home garden are usually grown from bare root plants or from tissue-cultured plants and should be planted in early Spring when the danger of any severe frosts has passed. The plants are usually planted in a row and the suckers will fill in the spaces to produce a hedge. Plant approximately 70 cm (27.5 in) apart, allowing 2.4–3 m (8–10 ft) between rows.

### Pruning

Allow the raspberry plants to fill in the row to a width of about 30–38 cm (12–15 in) during the course of the growing season. Remove any suckers which are produced outwith this row. After harvest, cut the fruited canes of summer-fruiting varieties to ground level. Select 6–8 of the strongest young canes on each plant and tie them to the supporting wires so that they are spaced 8–10 cm (3–4 in) apart. Cut all of the canes of Autumn fruiting varieties to ground level after harvest. Cut back canes as needed in the summer if required to prevent crowding.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Cane blight Leptosphaeria coniothyrium

- Symptoms: Purple black cankers form at wounds on young canes; cankers enlarge to encircle cane and cause wilting and death of lateral shoots; infected canes are often cracked and brittle, breaking easily; black specks (fungal fruiting bodies) may become visible in the cankers.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Spread by rain splash from infected to healthy canes.

- Management: Management Always plant raspberries in full sun and in an area with good drainage; plant only certified planting material; avoid over fertilizing plants; remove and destroy fruiting canes immediately after harvest; if pruning is necessary then make cuts during dry weather to allow wounds to heal before wet weather; control insect pests which may cause wounds to the canes such as crown borers and stem girdlers.

#### Gray mold Botrytis cinerea

- Symptoms: Blasting symptoms (browning and drying) of one, or a cluster, of blossoms; soft, light brown areas on fruits which enlarge rapidly; berries become mummified and is covered in a gray powdery substance;

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors high moisture and slow drying areas.

- Management: Management Always plant raspberries in full sun and in an area with good drainage; plant only certified planting material; avoid over fertilizing plants; remove and destroy fruiting canes immediately after harvest; practice good weed management around the raspberry canes; harvest fruit frequently and during dry weather; remove and destroy diseased berries to reduce inoculum.

#### Raspberry leaf spot Sphaerulina rubi

- Symptoms: The symptoms appear on young leaves as small dark green circular spots. As the disease progress the spots become light tan to gray color. Later the infected tissue may fall out. Severely infected leaves may fall off prematurely.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Spores are spread by splashing water.

- Management: Management Remove infected crop debris and burn them. Provide proper air circulation around the plant. If the disease is severe, spray suitable fungicide.

#### Spur blight Didymella applanata

- Symptoms: Purple-brown lesions on the stem just under the leaf or bud; lesions are usually on the lower portion of the stem; bark splitting on canes lengthways; brown triangular lesions may form on edges of leaves.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus is able to overwinter on diseased canes and disperse during rainfall and active wind.

- Management: Management Increase air circulation within the canopy by reducing the frequency of periods of leaf wetness (avoid overhead irrigation where possible) and thinning plants to reduce crowding; avoid excessive application of fertilizer, particularly nitrogen; practice good weed management; if disease is severe then an an application of appropriate fungicide may be merited.

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Soilborne disease; emergence favors wet soil conditions.

- Management: Management Once the disease has been introduced to a field then there is no method of treatment; good sanitation practices are important for preventing the introduction of the fungus into the plantation; always plant raspberries in well-draining soils or raised beds; one of the most effective methods of preventing the disease is to plant raspberry varieties which are resistant to the disease.


# Rhubarb

## Description

## Uses

The rhubarb petioles can be eaten fresh or cooked, usually with sugar to balance the sharp flavor of the plant. Rhubarb is a popular ingredient in pies and desserts.Basic requirements

Rhubarb grows best in temperate climates with cool summers and winters which result in the ground freezing. The plant requires winter temperatures below 4.4°C (40°F) to break dormancy. Rhubarb will grow optimally at temperatures of 15–20°C (59–68°F) and is adapted to high rainfall as long as there is adequate drainage. Plants will grow best in a fertile, well-draining soils rich in organic matter with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.

## Propagation

Rhubarb can be propagated from seed but it is more common to grow from whole crowns or cut pieces of the crown (divisions). Each division of the crown should possess at least one healthy bud. Crowns should be planted as soon as possible after purchasing/dividing to prevent them drying out. This is best performed in early Spring to allow the new plants to establish in the soil. Choose a site that receives full sun. An area that receives afternoon shade may be beneficial in warmer areas. Prepare the site for planting by loosening the soil with a fork to a depth of approximately 25 cm (10 in). Encorporate organic matter such as a good quality compost or well-aged manure into the soil prior to planting and a small amount of fertilizer. Rhubarb crowns and divisions Planting should be planted at a depth of 5 cm (2 in) leaving 1 m (3.3 ft) between plants and 1.5–1.8 m (5–6 ft) between rows. Once in the ground, tamp the soil firmly around the crowns and water deeply.

General care and maintenance

Rhubarb requires regular watering during dry weather. a layer of organic mulch such as straw applied over newly planted crowns will help to conserve soil moisture while suppressing weeds. The soil should be kept moist but not wet. Rhubarb should be fertilized with nitrogen to promote vigorous and healthy growth. Nitrogen can be supplied at planting through the addition of well composted manure or a good quality compost. Nitrogen side-dressings should be made at regular intervals throughout the growing season. Rates should be adjusted based on the results of a soil test.

### Harvesting

Rhubarb should not be harvested in the first year after planting if the plant is to be maintained as a perennial. In the second year, stalks may be harvested as they mature. Leaves should be fully mature prior to harvest. Stalks should be harvested by hand cutting. Always ensure that foliage remains on the plant. Do not overharvest.

- Comments: Slugs prefer moist, shaded habitats and will shelter in weeds or organic trash; adults may deposit eggs in the soil throughout the season; damage to plants can be extensive

- Management: Management Practice good garden sanitation by removing garden trash, weeds and plant debris to promote good air circulation and reduce moist habitat for slugs and snails; handpick slugs at night to decrease population; spread wood ashes or eggshells around plants; attract molluscs by leaving out organic matter such as lettuce or grapefruit skins, destroy any found feeding on lure; sink shallow dishes filled with beer into the soil to attract and drown the molluscs; chemical controls include ferrous phosphate for organic gardens and metaldehyde (e.g. Buggeta) and carbaryl (e.g Sevin bait) for non-organic growers


# Rice

## Description

There are two species of cultivated rice in the world, Oryza sativa (Asian rice) and Oryza glaberrima (African rice). Both species are annual grasses (except in the tropics, where the plant can be perennial) that are cultivated for their grain which is considered a staple food in most parts of the world.

Asian and African rice plants are morphologically very similar and can be difficult to tell apart. They have rounded stems (called culms) which are divided into nodes and internodes. The plant leaves are borne on the nodes of the stem and are long and slender with a pronounced midrib.

The plant produces three flowers, two of which are reduced, on a spikelet on the terminal (last) internode of the stem. The rice grain is formed by the ripened ovary of the flower and is between 5 and 12 mm in length. Rice is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season, and can reach a height of between 1 and 1.8 m (3.3– 5.9 ft) depending on the variety.

Rice is grown in four ecosystems, which are broadly defined based on water regimes. The ecosystems are irrigated rain-fed lowland and upland, and flood- prone.

Generally, African rice tends to form smaller, pear-shaped grains with red bran and olive to black seed coat and has several disadvantages compared with its Asian counterpart e.g. seed is easily scattered, the grain is difficult to mill and the crop gives a lower yield. The growing of Asian rice has therefore begun to supersede that of African rice in West Africa. Asian rice originates from China and African rice is believed to have been domesticated in areas around the Niger River in Africa.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Oryza sativa

Common Name: Mchele(husked rice), Mpunga (upland rice)- Swahili

## Uses & Benefits

Rice is a vital staple food for over half of the world's population, offering numerous uses and benefits. As a primary energy source, it provides essential carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Rice is gluten-free, making it suitable for people with dietary restrictions, and its whole grain form, such as brown rice, supports digestive health and weight management. It is used in animal feed, cosmetics, and industrial products like rice bran oil. Economically, it supports millions of farmers and contributes to employment. Environmentally, rice farming helps maintain biodiversity and can sequester carbon, aiding in climate change mitigation.

## Varieties

"Sindano", highly susceptible to Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (RYMV), and "Basmati 217", highly susceptible to blast, have been grown since the 1960s.

The upland "NERICA" rice varieties were developed at the Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) ex-WARDA. They are resistant to blast, RYMV stemborers, and leafminers and are high yielding and doing well from West Africa to Uganda.

In Kenya, they have great potential for medium altitudes with high rainfall or the possibility for irrigation. "NERICA" can be planted as other small grains, but does need irrigation, especially during flowering, and fertilization.

Varieties in Tanzania

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Rice thrives on land that is water saturated or even submerged during part or all of its growth. Optimal temperatures for rice growing are 20 to 37.7°C, and no growth occurs below 10ºC. The optimal pH is between 5 and 7, though rice has been grown in fields with a PH between 3 and 10. Rice will grow in altitudes ranging from 0 to 2500 m above sea level but worldwide is mostly grown on the humid coastal lowlands and deltas. Aquatic rice may require a dependable supply of fresh, slowly moving water, at a temperature of 21 to 29°C. Rain-fed rice requires an average of 800 to 2000 mm of rainfall well distributed over the growing season. If rainfall is less than 1250 mm annually, irrigation is used to make up the deficit. The crop is salt tolerant at some stages of growth; during germination but not seedling stages and has even been grown to reclaim salty soils. Terrain should be level enough to permit flooding, yet sloped enough to drain readily. The soils on which rice can grow are as varied as the climatic regime it tolerates, but ideally, it prefers a friable loam overlying heavy clay, as in many coastal and delta areas.

### Growing from Seed

Rice is always propagated by seed, which may be either broadcast or drilled directly in the field, or the seedlings may be grown in nurseries and transplanted. Direct seeding is done in dry or puddled soil. In puddled soil, the (pre-germinated) seeds are broadcast. The water level is kept at 0-5 cm under tropical conditions, but higher in temperate areas.

In dry soil, the seeds are sown after land preparation and covered lightly with soil by a tooth harrow. Germination occurs after heavy continuous rains. In upland rice cultivation the land is prepared in the dry weather and the rice is broadcast or dibbled in with the advent of the rains. Floating rice is cultivated in areas subject to deep flooding and the seed is sown either dry or wet.

### Seedling production

The following are steps for producing healthy seedlings:

Seed selection: Select plump and healthy seeds.

Seed pre-treatment: This is practiced to secure better germination of seeds and better growth of seedlings. It involves:

Seed disinfection: Hot water treatment is effective in destroying the nematode Aphelenchoides besseyi, which causes white tip disease.

Seed soaking: To supply the required moisture for germination, shorten the germination period and reduce seed rotting. During the soaking period change water to remove poisonous substances and allow entry of fresh air.

Pre-sprouting: The seeds are drained and covered with grass for 24 to 48 hours. This ensures uniform seed germination, avoids sprouting, and allows air circulation for germination.

Sowing: Sowing 80 to 100 g/m² is normal practice. Broadcast seed uniformly. Do not submerge the nursery bed after sowing. Use a seed rate of about 20 kg/acre (50 kg/ha).

Seedbed preparation (nursery): Plough at least 2 weeks before sowing and flooding. Puddle 1 week before sowing and prepare a raised nursery bed. Drain the nursery bed the day before sowing to stabilize the surface of the soil. If the soil covering the nursery bed is too soft, sown grains are buried in the soil resulting in a poor establishment. For 1 ha of transplanted rice, a nursery of about 350 m² is required. Irrigate a few days after sowing so that the surface is kept moist, and as the seedlings emerge keep submerged conditions with water controlled at 1 to 3 cm according to the growth of the seedling. Raise the water level to 10 cm one day before uprooting to ease the washing off of soil that sticks to roots. This will make transplanting easy.

### Land Preparation

Preparation of land varies, even within the lowland rainfed-rice areas. Land can be prepared in the following ways:

Wetland tillage: This method is common in most tropical Asian countries. It consists of land soaking, in which water is absorbed until the soil is saturated. Ploughing, which is the initial breaking and turning over of the soil to a depth of 10-20 cm, is done using a wooden or light iron plough drawn by 1-2 buffaloes or oxen, preferably when there is 7.5-10 cm of water on the land and harrowing during which big clods of soil are broken and puddled with water. Puddling is important because it reduces moisture loss by percolation, better weed control, and ease of transplanting. The low redox potential of submerged puddled soil helps to conserve water-soluble nutrients, favors the accumulation of ammonium, increases biological nitrogen fixation, and increases the availability of phosphorus, silicon, iron, and manganese.

Dryland tillage: The land is prepared in the dry weather and the rice is sown just before the rains begin. This method makes it possible to have initial crop growth from early monsoon rains. Labor requirements for seed-bed preparation, land preparation, and transplanting are reduced and soil structure is better for stand establishment of the following non-rice crop. This method has its disadvantages: weed control is a major problem; percolation losses are high, making the chances of drought stress higher; and fertilizer requirements are often higher. To hold the water on the land and maintain it at the required depth, bunding and leveling are essential. The land is divided by contour bunds into fields, the size and shape of which vary with the topography. The bunds are usually made of clay, mud, and weeds, with controlled openings for the ingress and egress of water.

### General Care and Maintenance

Maintain adequate water levels, typically 2-5 cm, especially during the early stages of growth, to control weeds and support seedling establishment. Ensure proper drainage during the grain-filling stage to avoid waterlogging and promote healthy grain development.

Apply balanced fertilizers, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, at recommended stages typically at planting, tillering, and panicle initiation. Regularly test the soil to determine nutrient needs and adjust fertilization accordingly.

### Harvesting

Harvesting rice involves timing the harvest when about 80-90% of the grains have turned golden yellow, indicating full maturity. Harvesting can be done manually using sickles or mechanically with combine harvesters, depending on the scale of farming. Proper timing is essential to avoid grain losses due to shattering or over-drying. After cutting, the rice should be carefully threshed to separate the grains from the stalks, followed by drying to reduce moisture content, which helps prevent spoilage and ensures the rice is ready for storage or milling.

# Rosemary

## Description

Rosemary, Rosmarinus officinalis, is an erect, bushy evergreen shrub in the family Lamiaceae grown for its leaves which are used as a herb. The rosemary plant is usually erect in growth habit and possess branched woody stems with tufts of leaves. The leaves are opposite and usually bladelike and glossy green. The plant produces clusters of 5–10 blue, purple or pink flowers on short lateral branches and small oval fruit. Rosemary plants can reach 2 m (6.6 ft) in height and can be productive for many years (up to 30 if conditions are favorable for its growth). Rosemary originates from the Mediterranean.

## Uses

Rosemary leaves can be used fresh or dried as a herb in cooking or in salads. The leaves and flowers can be used to extract rosemary oil which is used as a seasoning or as a scent in soaps and household products.Basic requirements

Rosemary is suited to both temperate and subtropical areas with most varieties growing optimally at temperatures between 6 and 24°C (39–75°F) in a well-draining loamy soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Rosemary plants require at least 6 hours of sun every day, direct sunlight being best. Rosemary can survive mild winters but will not tolerate temperatures that are regularly below -3°C (26.6°F). Established rosemary is very drought resistant.

## Propagation

Rosemary can be propagated from seed, cuttings, or by air layering. Seeds germinate slowly, emerging after 3–4 weeks, and have a low germination rate so vegetative propagation is preferred. Cuttings should be taken from healthy, vigorous plants by taking a clipping about 7.6 cm (3 in) in length from the end of a branch. The leaves should be removed from the lower half of the cutting before planting in light textured potting media to root. The cutting should be watered regularly and kept moist, but not wet while they root. The new plants will be ready for transplanting after approximately 8 weeks. after hardening, transplants should be planted 45 cm (18 in) apart allowing 1.2 m (4 ft) between rows.

General care and maintenance

Rosemary is very prone to root rot and should therefore be planted in a well-draining soil and watered sparingly. Allow the soil to dry before watering, generally watering once every 1–2 weeks is sufficient but watering should be adjusted to suit climatic conditions. Plants will benefit from the regular addition of a balanced fertilizer. A layer of mulch will protect the plants over winter.

### Harvesting

Rosemary can be harvested as soon as the plant is established in the the ground and has reached a suitable size. Branches are harvested by cutting the terminal growth (25–30 cm/9.8–11.8 in) before they become woody. Rosemary can be harvested several times in one season but it is important to allow the plant to recover and replace growth before the next harvest.

# Rutabaga

## Description

Rutabaga, Brassica napus, is an herbaceous biennial in the family Brassicaceae grown primarily for its edible root. The plant is believed to be a hybrid of turnip and wild cabbage. The leaves grow from a stout swollen stem (neck) close to the ground forming the crown the plant. Rutabaga leaves are thick smooth and waxy. They are lobed and have a bluish hue. The plant produces light yellow flowers which are clustered at the top of a raceme. Unlike turnip, the flowers do not extend above the terminal buds. The taproot of the plant is is a bulbous tuber, almost perfectly round, which can be purple, white or yellow with yellow flesh. Rutabaga plants can reach in height of 30–46 cm (12–18 in) and although biennial, they are commonly grown as an annual, harvested after one growing season. Rutabaga may also be referred to as swede or yellow turnip and originates from Europe.

## Uses

Rutabaga roots are usually consumed as a vegetable after cooking. The leaves are also edible and can be eaten fresh in salads or after cooking.Basic requirements

Rutabagas are cold hardy vegetables which can be grown early in the spring for a summer harvest or in the summer for harvesting in late fall. They prefer a fertile, well draining soil which has a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. The soil should have a loose texture for optimum root development. Rutabagas will grow best in full sun but will tolerate partial shade. The average daily temperature should fall between 10–18°C (50–65°F) for adequate growth.

### Planting

Rutabagas are usually direct seeded and can be sown as soon as the soil is workable in the Spring. For a Fall harvest, sow seeds about 2 months before the first frost in your area. Prepare the soil for planting by loosening it with a fork to a depth of about 30–38 cm (12–15 in). Remove any large rocks if present. Incorporate 2–4 inches of compost into the soil prior to planting. Sow seeds by broadcasting and raking 13 mm (0.5 in) into the soil. Thin seedlings to a final spacing of 7.5–10 cm (3–4 in). Alternatively, seeds can be sown in rows spaced 30–45 cm(12–18 in) apart.

General care and maintenance

Water rutabagas evenly and keep the soil moist for optimum growth. Mulching the plants will help to conserve moisture in the soil. Pull any weeds as they appear, the soil can be cultivated down to 2.5–5.0 cm (2–3 in) when the plants are small but this should be reduced as the plants grow larger to prevent damage to delicate feeder roots.

### Harvesting

Rutabaga greens can be harvested from the plant when the leaves are about 10 cm (10 in) tall. If growing for both greens and roots then only remove 2–3 leaves from each plant. Roots are ready to harvest when they reach 2.5–7.5 cm (1–3 in) in diameter. Small rutabagas can often be harvested by gently pulling from the soil by hand but larger roots in heavier soil may need gently dug up with a garden fork. Store unwashed roots in a root cellar or basement.

# Rye

## Description

Rye, Secale cereale, is an herbaceous annual or biennial in the family Poaceae that is grown primarily for its grain. Rye has an erect slender stem topped with a curved spike which is 7–15 cm (3–6 in) length. The head is made up of individual spikelets each with two florets which produce 1–2 kernels. The spikelets and arranged alternately along the length of the head.The leaves of the plant grow from nodes on the stem and are lance-like blades, blue-green in color. Rye can reach 1–3 m (3.3–10 ft) in height and is either grown as an annual (spring rye) or biennial (winter rye).  Modern rye does not occur naturally but is likely derived from wild ancestors found in Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle East.

## Uses

Rye grain can be used to make alcoholic drinks such as whiskey, gin and beer or used as a livestock feed. Rye flour can be used to make bread. Rye is extensively grown as a winter cover crop to prevent soil erosion and the mature stems are commonly used as animal bedding.Basic requirements

Rye is a cool season annual grass which can be grown in a wide range of soils and climates. Rye grows best when planted in well draining sandy or light loams but can also be grown in clay soils. The optimum pH for rye growth is between 5.6 and 6.5. Rye will germinate when soil temperatures are between 4 and 5°C (39–41°F). Daily temperatures should not exceed an average of 20°C in order for the plant to grow adequately. Winter rye should be planted in fall to mid-winter depending on the variety and be overwintered for a summer harvest, while spring rye is planted in the spring for summer harvest.

## Propagation

Rye is propagated directly from seed and can be sown by broadcasting or by drilling. Seeds should be sown to a depth of 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in) allowing 15–18 cm (6–7 in) between rows where seeds are drilled. Seeding If seeds are broadcast, they must be covered to ensure adequate germination. Seeding rates are generally between 100 to 150 kg of seed per hectare for winter rye and 150 to 200 kg per hectare for spring rye to produce a plant stand of 200-300 plants per square meter.

General care and maintenance

Rye fields should be kept free from weeds through the use of herbicides or by harrowing. Herbicides may be applied while the plants are at the tillering stage of growth. Rye will benefit from the addition of nitrogen which is often the biggest yield limiting factor in rye cultivation. Fertilizer should be applied when the crop begins to grow and the application may be split over two applications.

### Harvesting

Rye is ready to harvest when the leaves are dead and the stems have turned yellow-brown in color. Rye is commonly harvested by combine but can also be harvested by hand.

# Sage

## Description

Sage, Salvia officinalis, is a perennial shrub in the the family Lamiaceae grown for its aromatic leaves which are used as a herb. Sage can be erect or grow along the ground and possesses a dense arrangement of woody stems with broad, elliptical,silvery-green leaves which are arranged alternately on the stems. The plant produces blue, pink or white flowers on a stalk. Sage plants generally grow to 40–70 cm (16–28 in) in height and can live to be 15–20 years old although they are usually replaced after 4–5 years in the garden when they become woody. Sage may also be referred to as common sage and originates from the Balkan peninsula.

## Uses

Sage leaves are used fresh or dry as a culinary herb. Oil can be extracted from the leaves and flowers of the plant and is used as a flavoring in alcoholic drinks and as a scent in perfume.Basic requirements

Sage is a grows best in a well draining, rich, clay loams with a pH between 6.5 and 7.0. It should be planted in full sun, although some afternoon shade is tolerated. Sage plants require warm temperatures and ample sunlight in order to produce a high essential oil content in the leaves.

## Propagation

Sage is usually propagated from seed, although both cuttings, divisions and air layering is also successfully practised. The planting site should be warm, dry and protected from wind. Seeds should be sown after all danger of frost has passed leaving 23 cm (9 in) between seeds. Fertilizer may be added to the soil prior to planting to aid development. Plants should be thinned to a final spacing of 45 cm (18 in).

General care and maintenance

Sage plants should be pruned in early Spring to promote new growth, or after flowering in the summer. In addition to an application at planting, sage will benefit from a side dressing of fertilizer 6 to 8 weeks after planting. Sage will become very woody within 3-4 years of planting and should be replaced with new plants.

### Harvesting

Sage is best harvested just before flowering when the essential oil content of the leaves is highest. Sage should be harvested by cutting the top 20 cm (8 in) of tender growth with a sharp knife. Commercial fields may be harvested by mowing but the highest quality product is achieved by harvesting only the leaves.

# Sorghum

## Description

Sorghum is a type of cereal grain that belongs to the grass family Poaceae (formerly known as Gramineae). It is one of the top five cereal crops in the world, and is widely grown in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

Sorghum is a tall, erect, annual grass that typically grows to a height of 1-2 meters. It has long, narrow leaves and produces large, compact clusters of grain on top of its stems. The grains are typically small and round, with a hard outer layer that is difficult to remove. Sorghum plants come in many different colors, including red, brown, white, and yellow, and some varieties have a sweet taste.

The crop is hardy, can tolerate heat and drought, and is adapted to a wide range of soil types. It is a relatively low-maintenance crop, requiring less water and fertilizer than many other grains, which makes it an important crop for farmers in many parts of the world.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Sorghum bicolor

Common Name: Swahili: mtama; Spanish: sorgo; French: sorgho; German: sorghum; Italian: sorgo; Portuguese: sorgo; Chinese (Mandarin): 高粱 (gāo liáng); Japanese: モロコシ (morokoshi); Hindi: ज्वार (jwar); Arabic: الذرة السوداء (al- dhurrah al-sawda)

## Uses & Benefits

Sorghum is a versatile and nutritious grain widely used in food production, animal feed, and industrial applications. In food, sorghum grains are utilized to make porridge, bread, pancakes, and even popped snacks, while sorghum flour, being gluten-free, serves as a key ingredient in gluten-free baking. Beyond human consumption, sorghum is a crucial component of animal feed, providing essential nutrients to livestock. Additionally, it is used in brewing beer, producing biofuels, and creating biodegradable packaging materials. Rich in antioxidants, fiber, and essential nutrients, sorghum offers numerous health benefits, including improved digestion, reduced inflammation, and support for cardiovascular health. Its drought-resistant nature also makes it a sustainable crop, contributing to food security in arid regions.

## Varieties

Sorghum is a versatile crop that comes in many different varieties, each with its own unique characteristics and uses. Grain sorghum, also known as milo, is the most widely grown type and is used for food, animal feed, and biofuel production. On the other hand, sweet sorghum has a high sugar content and is used for the production of sorghum syrup, molasses, and other sweeteners. Forage sorghum, which is primarily used for animal feed, is harvested for its leaves and stalks rather than its grain. There is also broomcorn sorghum grown for the production of brooms and brushes, which are made from the plant's long, stiff fibers. Dual-purpose sorghum, as the name suggests, is grown for both grain and forage and is used to feed both humans and animals. High-tannin sorghum, on the other hand, is grown for its high tannin content, which makes it resistant to bird and insect damage.

There are many specialty varieties of sorghum that are grown for specific uses, such as ornamental purposes, traditional medicine, and cultural practices.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Sorghum is a highly adaptable crop that can grow in a variety of climatic, soil, and water conditions. However, there are certain optimal conditions for growing the crop that can maximize its yield and quality.

Sorghum is a warm-season crop that requires a long growing season with high temperatures and plenty of sunshine. It can tolerate drought, but excessive rainfall or humidity can increase the risk of diseases and reduce yield. Generally, sorghum grows well in areas with an average annual rainfall of 400–600 mm, although it can also be grown in areas with lower rainfall if there is access to irrigation.

Sorghum can grow in a wide range of soil types, from sandy to clayey, but it prefers well-drained soils with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. It is important to have good soil fertility and adequate levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for optimal growth and yield. The soil should also be free of weeds and other pests that can compete with sorghum for nutrients and water.

Sorghum requires adequate moisture throughout its growing season, but it is also drought-tolerant and can survive in areas with limited water availability. It is important to have a reliable water source, either through rainfall or irrigation, to ensure that sorghum has enough water to grow and develop. However, overwatering can also be detrimental to sorghum, as it can lead to waterlogging and reduced yields.

Sorghum is a highly adaptable crop that can grow in a variety of climatic, soil, and water conditions. However, there are certain optimal conditions for growing sorghum that can maximize its yield and quality.

### Growing from Seed

The planting procedure for sorghum can vary depending on factors such as climate, soil conditions, and the specific sorghum variety being grown. However, there are some general guidelines that can help ensure the successful planting and growth of sorghum.

Seed selection: Choose high-quality sorghum seeds that are adapted to your climate and soil conditions. It is important to select seeds that are disease- free and have high germination rates.

Land preparation: Prepare the land by removing any weeds, rocks, or other debris that may interfere with planting. Till the soil to a depth of 15-20 cm to loosen the soil and improve drainage.

Planting time: Sorghum should be planted during the warmer months when the soil temperature has reached at least 15°C. The specific planting time will depend on the location and climate, but generally, sorghum is planted in the spring or early summer.

Planting method: Sorghum can be planted using various methods, such as direct seeding or transplanting. Direct seeding involves planting seeds directly into the soil, while transplanting involves starting the seeds in a nursery and then transplanting the seedlings into the field.

Seed spacing: Space the seeds according to the recommended spacing for your sorghum variety. Typically, sorghum seeds are planted in rows with a spacing of 60–75 cm between rows and 10–20 cm between seeds.

### General Care and Maintenance

Apply fertilizers such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as recommended based on soil test results and the specific sorghum variety being grown. Provide adequate water for the seeds to germinate and establish. The amount of water required will depend on the soil moisture level and the climate.

### Harvesting

The harvesting procedure for sorghum can vary depending on the specific variety, climate, and soil conditions. However, there are some general steps that can help ensure a successful and efficient harvest:

Determine maturity: Sorghum should be harvested when it reaches physiological maturity, which is when the seed head turns from green to yellow, brown, or red and the seeds become hard and difficult to dent.

Timing: The timing of the harvest will depend on the climate and variety, but generally, sorghum is harvested during the dry season, when the seeds have matured and dried out.

Equipment: Use appropriate equipment, such as a combine harvester or sickle, to harvest the sorghum.

Cutting: Use a sickle or combine harvester to cut the stalks near the base of the plant. The stalks can be cut at a height of 10-15 cm above the ground to leave some stubble for erosion control and soil conservation.

Drying: Allow the sorghum to dry in the field for a few days to a week to reduce moisture content and improve storage quality.

Threshing: Use a thresher or other equipment to remove the seeds from the seed head. Alternatively, the seed heads can be beaten with a stick to release the seeds.

Soybean, Glycine max, is an herbaceous annual plant in the family Fabaceae grown for its edible seeds. The soybean plant is usually an erect bush with woody stems and alternately arranged leaves.  The leaves possess three individual leaflets which are oval or lance-like in shape, growing to a length of 3–10 cm (1.2–4.0 in). The soybean plant produces small white or purple flowers and curved seed pods which are 3–15 cm (1.2–6 in) in length and can contain between 1 and 5 seeds. The seeds can be a variety of colors including yellow, green, brown, black or a mottled combination. Soybean is an annual plant, surviving only one growing season and can reach heights of 0.2–1.5 m (0.7–1.4 ft). Soybean may also be referred to as soyabean or soya and originates from Northeast China.

## Uses

Soybean seeds can be used to make flour and dairy substitutes such as milk, margarine and yogurt and meat substitutes such as veggie burgers. Oil can be extracted from both the seeds and pods and the by product of the extraction is used as an animal feed. The oil from the plant is used in products such as paint, linoleum and soap. Soybean is also grown as a cover crop and used as animal fodder or hay.Basic requirements

Soybean is a short-day plant, requiring hot weather for optimum production. It can be grown year round in most parts of the tropics. Plants can be grown at ambient temperatures between 15 and 27°C (60–80°F) although temperature below 21°C (69.8°F) and above 32 (89.6°F) may reduce flowering. Temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F) are detrimental to seed production. Soybeans are adapted to grow in a wide range of soils and climates but require adequate soil moisture for germination and seedling establishment. Plants are sensitive to waterlogging but are tolerant of drought conditions once established. Soybean grows best on a light, loose, well draining loam with a pH of 6.5.

## Propagation

Soybean is propagated directly from seed. If seeds are to planted in a field where soybean has not been been grown in the 3–5 year previous, they should first be inoculated with nitrogen fixing bacteria. The seedbed should be prepared prior to planting by removing any crop residue, weeds and large stones. Tilling the soil helps to break up large clods of earth. Seeds may be sown mechanically or by hand. in tilled soils, seeds are usually planted at a depth 3.2–4.5 cm (1.25 to 1.75 in) in rows spaced 30 cm (11.8 in) apart. Alternatively, no-till planting may be used to plant seeds in the stubble of a previous crop without first cultivating the soil. With this method, seeds are drilled into the soil in rows spaced 17.8 cm (7 in) apart. No-till practices reduce soil erosion and reduces the loss of moisture in the soil.

General care and maintenance

Weeds are often a problem in soybean fields and can be reduced through good preparation of the seedbed and maintaining a weed-free seedbed for several weeks prior to planting. Weeds may be controlled with appropriate herbicides, where available, or through mechanical cultivation where necessary. Soybeans should be provided with irrigation at flowering and again at seed-set for maximum seed fill and optimal yield. Irrigation should be increased in sandy soils that do not retain as much moisture. Soybeans fix approximately half of the nitrogen they require for growth and the other half must be supplied from the soil or through fertilizer application. Soybean also requires an adequate supply of phosphorus and potassium and application rates should be based on the results of a soil test.

### Harvesting

Soybeans are ready to harvest between 70 and 160 days after planting, depending on variety. Plants are ready for harvest when the leaves and stems have turned yellow and the seed pods brown to black. Soybeans for fresh use are cut while still green. Plants may be pulled by hand or cut with the use of a combine. Once cut, the seeds are removed from the pods by threshing.

# Spinach

## Description

Spinach, Spinacia oleracea, is a leafy herbaceous annual plant in the family Amaranthaceae grown for its leaves which are used as a vegetable. The spinach plant has simple leaves which stem from the center of the plant and measure about 2–30 cm (0.8–12.0 in) long and 1 to 15 cm (0.4–6.0 in) across. The leaves grow in a rosette and can appear crinkled or flat. The plant produces small yellow-green flowers which are 3–4 mm (0.1 in) in diameter. The flowers produce small fruit clusters which contain seeds.   Spinach is an annual and survives only one growing season and can reach 30 cm (12 in) in height. Spinach originates from ancient Persia (now Iran).

## Uses

Spinach is eaten cooked as a vegetable and contains both large amounts iron, calcium, and other essential vitamins and minerals.Basic requirements

Spinach grows well in cool areas and can survive the first frost of temperate climates. It will germinates and grows optimally at temperatures between 4 and 16°C (40–60°F) but can withstand temperatures as low as -7C (20°F). Spinach grows best in a well draining loamy soil with a pH between 6.4 and 6.8. It is sensitive to acidic soil and if the pH is too high, adding lime is recommended.  The soil temperature should not exceed 21°C (70°F).

## Propagation

Spinach is propagated from seed with round seeded spinach usually being sown in early spring for a summer harvest and the prickly seeded type which is usually sown in fall for harvest in winter and spring. Seeds should be planted at a depth of 1–2 cm (0.5–1 in) leaving 33–38 cm (13-15 in) between rows. When seedlings reach about 5 cm (2 in) in height they should be thinned out to a spacing of 8–10 cm (3–4 in) between plants.

General care and maintenance

Spinach requires high levels of moisture, and if rainfall is inadequate, 2.5 cm (1 in) of water should be applied every 7–10 days. Spinach also has high requirements for nitrogen and potassium which should be provided by applying fertilizer based on the results of a soil test. Potassium poses little environmental risk and may be applied based on the results of a soil test. Timing of nitrogen applications vary by location as there is a risk of leaching during heavy rainfall. In the home garden, fertilizer is often not required as long as spinach is planted in a fertile soil.

### Harvesting

Spinach leaves can be harvested as soon as they are large enough to use and may be harvested by hand or machine. Individual leaves may be harvested as required in the home garden or the whole plant can be cut. In commercial production, bunched fresh spinach is usually cut by hand. SPinach for processing may be cut by machine.

## Common Pests and Diseases

# Squash

## Description

Squash is the collective name given to several species of plant in the genus Cucurbita, including  C. maxima, C. mixta ,  C. moschata and C. pepo, which are widely grown for their edible fruit. Squash plants are are herbaceous annual plants which are either trailing vines or bush-like in morphology.  Vines generally have large, lobed leaves and long vines which can climb by attaching to surfaces with their tendrils.  Bushes generally take up less space than the sprawling vine types and may have prickly leaves. Squash plants produce yellow or orange flowers and green, white or yellow fruit in a variety of shapes and sizes with smooth or ridged skin. Vining squash varieties can reach several meters in length and, as annuals, survive only one growing season. Squash originate from North and Central America and are referred to by their cultivar name e.g. acorn squash, butternut squash, spaghetti squash, zucchini, banana squash, hubbard squash and buttercup squash.

## Uses

Squash fruit can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable. Some varieties are grown as ornamentals.Basic requirements

Squash is a warm-season crop, requiring lots of sun and good drainage to develop optimally and growing best at temperatures between 18 and 25°C (65–75°F). Squash will yield best if grown in a fertile, well-draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5. Squash should be planted in  full sun and provided with ample soil moisture due to their shallow root system. Vining varieties can grow to very large sizes and require a good deal of space. Smaller bush varieties are available for more modest spaces.

## Propagation

Squash is propagated from seed and can be direct seeded or sown indoors and transplanted. If direct seeding,seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 15.6°C (60°F). Sow 1–2 seeds 1.3–2.5 cm (0.5–1.0 in) deep, at least 90 cm (~3 ft) apart if growing bush varieties and 120–150 cm (4–5 ft) apart if growing vining varieties. Allow a further 1–3 m (6–10 ft) between rows depending on the variety.  If transplanting, seeds should be sown 3–4 weeks before the last frost date in your area and transplanted before the plants develop their second set of true leaves. Seeds in sown both indoors and out require lightly moist soil for germination, care should be taken to avoid overwatering. Seeds should germinate in 5–10 days depending on the soil temperature.

General care and maintenance

Squash vines are sprawling and require plenty space to grow. Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence. Squash also require a continuous supply of water and where drip irrigation is not being used, plants should be watered deeply once per week, providing at least an inch of water. Shallow watering or watering less frequently encourages a shallow root system. Mulches can be used to conserve soil moisture and black polyethylene mulch has the advantage of warming the soil. All squash varieties produce both male and female flowers (monoecious) and are pollinated by insects such as bees.

### Harvesting

Squash is ready to harvest when the rind is hard and cannot be punctured with a fingernail. The skin of mature fruits is dull and dry in appearance, especially when compared with the shiny skin of an immature fruit.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

# Starfruit (Carambola)

## Description

The Carambola tree, Averrhoa carambola, is a woody plant in the family Oxalidaceae grown for its fruit known as starfruit.  Carambola trees are small, bushy evergreens with drooping branches. The tree possesses soft compound leaves composed of 2–5 leaflets which are green in color and arranged in a spiral around the branches.  Each leaf is 15–20 cm (5.9–7.9 in) long and each leaflet 3.8–9 cm (1.5–3.5 in) long. The leaflets are oval or ovate in shape.  The tree produces small lilac or purple flowers and   The waxy fruit is orange-yellow in color, 7.5–12.5 cm (3.0–4.9 in) in length, oval and deeply ribbed.  The Carambola tree has a lifespan of 40 years and reaches a height of 7–10 m (22–33 ft), spreading 6–7.6 m (20–25 ft) in diameter.  Carambola may also be referred to as averrhoa, starfruit, five corner or coromandel gooseberry and originates from Southeast Asia.

## Uses

Carambola fruit can be eaten fresh or cooked and the juice can be used in iced beverages. The fruit is also used in relishes or as a seasoning.Basic requirements

Carambola is a tropical to subtropical tree which grows best in warm to hot temperatures between 20 and 35°C (68–95°F). Trees will generally cease to grow at temperatures below 18.3°C (65°F) although established trees can withstand short periods at -2.8°C (27°F). Carambola can be grown successfully in many soil types, from heavy clay to sandy soils but will perform optimally in a rich, well-draining loam with a pH between 4.5 to 7.0 Trees will not tolerate waterlogging but do require a moist soil for optimum production.

## Propagation

Carambola is commonly grown from seed although veneer grafting onto suitable rootstock yields the best results for commercial production. Seeds only remain viable for a few days and should be plump and fully developed for propagation. Seeds should be planted in a well-draining potting media such as peat moss and will germinate in approximately 7 days depending on temperature.  Once seeds have germinated, they should be transplanted into individual containers containing sandy loam soil. The seedlings should be kept in these containers until they are transplanted. Carambola trees should be planted in full sun and spaced 9 m (30 ft) apart.

General care and maintenance

Carambola trees require moist soil for optimum production. Young trees should be irrigated regularly after planting to promote establishment in the soil. Older trees should be watered regularly from flowering to fruit set. A layer of mulch around the trees will help to conserve moisture in the soil but should not be mounded up against the trunks.  Young carambola will benefit from applications of fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and magnesium every  30 to 60 days. Established, mature trees should be fertilized 4 to 6 times per year. Young trees should be pruned in the first 1–2 years after planting by cutting the tips off of branches which are greater than 60–90 cm (2–3 ft) in length to encourage branching. Older trees should be pruned to maintain a manageable height.

### Harvesting

Carambola fruit does not ripen off the tree and should be harvested when fully mature. Fruits are ready to harvest when they have turned from green to yellow in color, with the tips of the ribs remaining green. Fully ripe fruit naturally fall from the tree but can be picked earlier if desired.

# Sunflower

## Description

Sunflower, Helianthus annuus, is an herbaceous annual plant in the family Asteraceae, grown for its seeds. The plant has a thick, hairy, erect stem which gives rise to a large flower head. The plant has large, broad lower leaves which are oval and arranged alternately on the stem and smaller, narrower upper leaves which are attached individually to the stem.  The flower head is a large disc reaching 10–30 cm (4–12 in) in diameter which is made up of 16–30 individual florets which are yellow-gold in color. The outer florets are sterile and produce the outer petals of the flower head, while the  inner florets will mature into the seeds in the central disc.  Sunflowers are annual plants, harvested after one growing season and can reach 1–3.5 m (3.3–11.5 ft) in height. Sunflower may also be referred to as girasole and originates from North America.

## Uses

Sunflower seeds can be eaten either fresh or cooked or used to extract oil which is widely used in cooking. The seeds are commonly harvested for bird seeds. Sunflowers are often grown as ornamental plants due to their large, attractive flower head.Requirements

Sunflowers are generally very easy to grow and thrive in areas with long hot summers which promote flowering. They grow best at temperatures between 21 and 25.5°C (70–78°F). Sunflowers  can be very large and require plenty of space although there are some varieties which have been specially bred to be compact for growing in smaller spaces or for growing in containers. Sunflowers will grow in a variety of soils as long as they are not waterlogged and can be grown successfully at a pH ranging from 6.0 to 7.5. A pH above 6.0 is not recommended. They should be grown in an area that receives full sunlight and it is preferable to provide them with some shelter from wind which can damage the stems e.g. along a fence or wall. Sunflowers originate from the dry prairie regions of North America and are drought resistant once established. Their easy to grow nature makes them ideal plants for growing with children.

### Planting

Sunflowers are most easily grown by direct seeding outdoors. In areas with a long growing season, they should be planted in late Spring after all danger of frost and when the soil has warmed through. However, in areas with short growing seasons, the seeds can be planted a week or two before the last frost date as the plants are tolerant to cold Prepare the soil for planting by digging to loosen the soil and break up any large clumps. Plant seeds 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in) deep and space them 10–15 cm (3–4 in) apart. If planting in rows, allow 0.75 m (~30 in) between each one. An application of a balanced fertilizer at planting promotes the development of a strong root system. The seeds should sprout in 7–10 days. When the seedlings are about 15 cm (6 in) tall with two pairs of true leaves, thin the plants to a final within row spacing of 60 cm (2 ft). Sow more seeds every 2–3 weeks for a continuous bloom over the summer.

### General care

Although sunflowers are drought resistant, frequent, deep watering promotes the development of a strong root system. The plants do not require fertilizing, indeed, addition of nitrogen promotes vegetative growth and will delay flowering. The stems of the plants can easily reach in excess of 1.8 m (6 ft) in height and will benefit from some support. Bamboo stakes work well.

### Harvesting

Sunflowers are ready to harvest when the back of the flowers begin to turn yellow and the flower head droops. Cut the stem about 5 cm (2 in) below the head and hang up to dry in a warm, well ventilated place for several weeks. When the heads are thoroughly dried, remove the seeds with a brush or by hand. Allow the seeds to dry out for a further few days before storing.

# Sweet potato

## Description

Sweet potato, a herbaceous perennial vine belonging to the Convolvulaceae family, is cherished for its versatile, edible storage roots or tubers. Native to Central America, this plant has now established itself across the globe. These robust vines, known for their heart-shaped lobed leaves and charming white or lavender flowers, can stretch up to 4m (13 ft) in a single growing season. Tubers come in a fascinating array of shapes and colors, from red, yellow, brown, and white to even purple.

Cultivated mainly in small-scale subsistence farming in East Africa, sweet potatoes are gradually gaining recognition among other indigenous foods. Its tubers are usually white, red, or purple, and increasingly, yellow-fleshed types are garnering popularity due to their high sugar, vitamin A, and lower dry matter content. Consumed either boiled or roasted, often accompanying milk, porridge, soups, or meat, they contribute significantly to diet diversity. Moreover, their young leaves, high in protein and essential vitamins like B1, B2, and folic acid, serve as a nutritious green vegetable. The vines also double as a fodder crop, providing a nutritious feed, especially during the dry season. This remarkable plant, thus, goes beyond being a mere staple, offering considerable nutritional and agronomic advantages.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Ipomoea batatas

Common Name: Viazi vitamu (Swahili); Makwasi (Kikamba, Kenya); Mapwoni (Luhya, Kenya)

## Uses & Benefits

Sweet potato tubers are consumed raw as a vegetable or processed into flour or starch. The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked.

## Varieties

Sweet potato varieties offer diverse benefits, ranging from yield and performance to culinary value and pest tolerance, with each possessing unique characteristics that reduce the risk of agricultural failure. The different varieties cater to various regional needs and are primarily grown in East Africa for subsistence farming, contributing not only to food diversity but also as a vital fodder crop during dry seasons.

Red-skinned varieties with cream flesh are popular across most regions of Kenya for their high yield. Additionally, the wide range of cultivars extends from the standard white, red, and purple types to the increasingly popular yellow-fleshed ones. The latter are particularly celebrated for their high sugar and vitamin A content, and lower dry matter composition, making them a powerful tool in fighting vitamin A deficiency in children.

Beyond their tubers, sweet potato plants provide young leafy shoots high in protein, approximately 20% of dry weight, and rich in b-carotene, thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (B2), folic acid, and ascorbic acid. These nutrient- rich leaves are often consumed as vegetables, thereby enhancing the plant's versatility and nutritional contribution. With each variety catering to different needs, sweet potatoes continue to gain popularity and form a critical part of the food and agricultural landscape

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

Sweet potato thrives in sunny conditions but can manage with 30-50% less sunlight. For optimal growth, it prefers an annual rainfall of 600-1600 mm, evenly distributed throughout the growing season. However, dry periods can encourage the growth of storage roots. Despite its drought tolerance, extended dry spells, particularly during planting or root development, can significantly reduce yields.

### Growing from Seed

Sweet potatoes can be planted at any time if there is no critical dry season. Planting early in the rainy season is best in regions with a critical dry season. If the rainy season is long and wet, it is usually planted near the end.

Sweet potato planting material is obtained from either vine cuttings, which is the most common source, or storage roots.

Plant cuttings should be planted at approximately 15 x 20 cm spacing if planting material is to be kept in a multiplication plot before planting the next crop. After 45 days, new growth may be ready for cutting.

Use of stem cuttings

Farmers obtain mature crop cuttings before or shortly after harvesting storage roots. The cuttings are either used to establish a maintenance field or planted directly into the next sweet potato crop.

The following factors influence yield when using stem cuttings: Choosing 'clean' planting material is critical. This includes removing any insects, soil, or signs of virus or fungal disease from the cuttings.

In general, the apical (tip) portion of the vine is superior to the middle or basal portions. This portion has been shown to establish faster than other portions and is less likely to be infested with sweet potato weevils and fungal pathogens.

For cultivars with long vines, the second or third cut is sufficient. If vine growth has been so rapid that the stem has not matured in the apical portion, the second cutting may be superior to the tip portion.

The number of nodes is more important than the length of the cut. The average size is 20-40 cm, with 5-8 nodes. Field conditions may influence the relationship between cutting length and crop development.

Farmers should experiment to see what length works best for their specific situation. Usually, one-third to two-thirds of the cutting is buried.

A minimum of 2-3 nodes, but up to approximately 8 nodes, are placed beneath the soil. The time between cutting and planting may affect yield depending on the storage conditions for the cuttings.

Storing cuttings in humid conditions for one to two days may encourage node rooting. Longer storage may be detrimental to the establishment due to the depletion of the cuttings' energy reserves.

To reduce losses, remove the leaves from the lower portion of the cutting and store bundles of cuttings in a cool, shady, wind-free location wrapped in a wet cloth or sack. If roots form during storage, they must be carefully planted to avoid root damage.

Use of storage roots: Storage roots are used while there are inadequate stem cuttings available or when pest and disease infestation is so severe that only a few healthy vines remain. Since the sprouts can be harvested mechanically from the seedbed, they can also be used in highly mechanized production. Healthy storage roots should be selected from high-yielding plants.

The roots are densely planted in a seedbed far from different candy potato crops. To help retain moisture, the roots are covered with about 3 cm of soil, and the bed is covered with straw. When the sprouts have grown effectively, they are cut near their base and planted in the field. To increase the number of cuttings, remove the sprout tips when they are about 20 cm long to promote branching.

Rapid seed multiplication: Rapid multiplication can be used when a large number of cuttings are required. Although sweet potato growers have not fully acknowledged the value of this practice, it may be the simplest way to produce a large number of planting materials.

The following steps are involved in this method: 30 cm cuttings are taken from established plants or sprouted storage roots. These are then cut into single- node cuttings with the attached leaf. The vine's tip is discarded.

A seedbed is produced by mixing loose, humus-rich soil with ash. Plant the single-node cuttings densely, with the stem section buried and the leaf upright. The seedbed is watered on a regular basis and kept moist, especially during the first week of the establishment. When the seedlings have developed enough roots, they should be transplanted into the field after about 2 weeks.

To avoid damaging the roots, they should be carefully removed from the seedbed. To avoid excessive evaporation and wilting, transplanting should be done in the late afternoon. Degeneration of planting material When the sweet potato is vegetatively propagated for several generations, yield decline is common.

This is usually due to a virus buildup, many of which have no obvious symptoms. This frequently gives the impression that a new variety (carrying few viruses) yields significantly higher than traditional varieties, when in fact it may not be any better after a year or two of virus accumulation. Heat treatment and meristem culture (from research institutions) can be used to remove viruses.

Depending on the severity of the original virus infestation, this process typically results in a yield increase of 20 to 200% for both vines and roots. The higher yield may be maintained in the field for several years before the virus load has built up.

### General Care and Maintenance

Soil management, especially maintaining organic matter, is crucial for water retention in rain-fed crops. Organic matter and plant mulches help soil retain moisture, reduce surface evaporation, and prevent soil crusting. They also enhance rainwater absorption. Weeds, competing for water, should be regularly removed and can be used as additional mulch.

Where irrigation is feasible, the aim should be to maintain consistent soil moisture. Watering should sufficiently wet the root zone without causing deep drainage or runoff. Overwatering can lead to nutrient leaching and contamination of water sources. Light-textured soils require more frequent, lesser amounts of irrigation to avoid runoff losses.

### Harvesting

Sweet potato harvesting requires careful timing and handling to ensure a successful yield. Typically, sweet potatoes are ready for harvest 90 to 120 days after planting, when the leaves start to yellow, indicating the tubers' maturity. It's crucial to harvest before the first frost, as cold weather can damage the tubers.

A few days before harvesting, watering should be stopped to harden the tubers' skin for easier storage. The soil around the plant should be loosened gently, as sweet potatoes bruise easily. When harvesting, use a garden fork or spade to lift the tubers carefully, starting about a foot away from the plant to avoid cutting them.

After harvesting, sweet potatoes should be cured to enhance their sweetness and heal any minor cuts. Curing involves storing them in a warm (27-30°C) and humid environment for 4 to 10 days, which helps develop their sugar content and toughens the skin for longer storage. Once cured, the tubers should be stored in a cool (13-16°C) and dry place, such as a root cellar or pantry.

It is important to avoid refrigerating sweet potatoes, as cold temperatures can negatively affect their texture and flavor. When properly harvested and stored, sweet potatoes can last for several months, making them a valuable and versatile crop.

- Management: Management Only disease-free seed material should be planted; sweet potato should not be planted in sites where sweet potato has been grown during the previous 3-4 years; transplant material should be collected from plant by making cuts above-ground; seed material should be treated with an appropriate fungicide prior to planting

#### Fusarium root and stem rot Fusarium solani

- Symptoms: Swollen and distorted base of stems; deep, dark rot extending deep into tuber and forming elliptical cavities; growth of white mold

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease can be spread by infected transplants

- Management: Management Disease is generally not a problem if good sanitation is implemented; select only disease-free roots for seed; use cut transplants rather than slips; practice crop rotation; treat seed roots with an appropriate fungicide prior to planting

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial soft rot Erwinia chrysanthemi

- Symptoms: Brown to black water-soaked lesions on stems and petioles which expand rapidly and and cause large areas of soft rot on the stem; stem may collapse causing several vines to wilt; entire plant may die; storage roots may develop areas of soft rot which is initially colorless, but eventually turns brown with a black margin

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Symptoms develop after hot weather; can effect stored tubers

- Management: Management Avoid wounding storage roots at all stages of growth; plant only disease-free seed material; discard any stored roots which become infected with the disease; vines for transplanting should be cut above the soil surface; plant sweet potato varieties which are resistant to the disease

#### Bacterial wilt Ralstonia solanacearum

- Symptoms: New sprouts wilting and have water-soaked bases which turn yellow-brown to dark brown in color; vascular system of the sprouts is discolored brown; infection of healthy transplants causes the lower portions of the stems to become water-soaked and turn a similar color to infected sprouts; yellow-brown streaks may develop inside storage roots and, if infection is severe, gray- brown water-soaked lesions may be present on the root surface

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: The bacteria causing the disease is an important pathogen of other crops but in sweet potato it is only severe in certain regions of China where it can cause 70-80% reductions in yield

- Management: Management Quarantine procedures have been put in place in regions of China where the disease is severe; only disease-free storage roots should be used for planting and planting should only be done in sites free of the disease; rotating sweet potato with a flood crop such as paddy rice or a non-host such as corn or wheat can be beneficial; growing sweet potato during cooler periods of the year allows some avoidance of the disease

#### Leaf and stem scab Sphaceloma batatas

- Symptoms: Small brown lesions on leaf veins which become corky in texture and cause veins to shrink which in turn causes leaves to curl; lesions on stem are slightly raised and have purple to brown centers with light brown margins; scabby lesions form on stems when lesions coalesce

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Leaf and stem scab is one of the most severe diseases of sweet potato; disease is most severe in regions where there is frequent fog, rain or dew accumulation and is common in Asia and Australia

- Management: Management Avoid the use of overhead irrigation; rotate sweet potato with other crops; use only disease-free planting material; destroy sweet potato crop residue immediately after harvest; application of appropriate fungicides can help to control the disease, good control of the disease can be achieved with benomyl and chlorothalonil where licensed for use

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Pox Streptomyces ipomoea

- Symptoms: Poor growth of plants; reduced yield; circular dark brown, corky lesions on tubers which are V-shaped in cross section; cracked and distorted tubers which resemble dumbells; rotting feeder roots

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease emergence favors light, sandy soils

- Management: Management The most effective method of controlling the disease is through the use of resistant varieties of sweet potato; if resistant varieties are not being used then the soil should be maintained at a low pHwhich is unfavorable to the pathogen; sweet potato should be rotated with other crops which are non-hosts to prevent build up of the pathogen in the soil; fumiigation of the soil prior to planting can be an effective method of reducing the severity of the disease

#### Sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV)

- Symptoms: Sweet potato virus disease is a disease complex caused by two viruses; sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV). The symptoms are sever stunting of infected plants, stunting, distorted and chlorotic mottle or vein clearing of the leaves. It is confirmed that SPCSV enhances the accumulation of SPFMV. The symptoms caused by SPCSV alone is negligible. Where as symptoms caused by SPFMV is localized, mild and often asymptomatic and won't cause significant damage to the plant. Common symptom include appearance of feathery, purple patterns on the leaves.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: It is estimated that SPVD causes yield loss up to 80 - 90%. The disease was first reported in 1939 from eastern Belgian Congo (present Democratic Republic of Congo). SPCSV is crinivirus of Closterviridae and SPFMV is potyvirus belong to Potyviridae. SPFMV is transmitted by a wide range of aphid species. SPCSV is transmitted by white flies (Bemisia tabaci).

# Tarragon

## Description

Tarragon, Artemisia dracunculus, is an herbaceous perennial in the family Asteraceae grown for its leaves which are used a culinary herb. The tarragon plant is erect with slender, often branching stems and simple needle-like leaves which are glossy green and very aromatic. The plant produces a drooping head at the end of the stem which contains up to 40 yellow-green florets. Tarragon can reach a height of 1.5 m (5 ft) and can live for many years, dying back in the Winter and regrowing in Spring. Tarragon may be referred to by their cultivar group and these include French tarragon and Russian Tarragon. The origin of the plant is unknown but it has a wide distribution which covers Europe, parts of Asia and North America.

## Uses

Tarragon leaves are used either fresh or dried as a culinary herb. Essential oil can be extracted from the leaves and flowers.Basic requirements

Tarragon grows best in temperate climates and can survive some light frost. Tarragon will perform optimally when planted in a dry location in full sun. Soil should be light in texture and well-draining, with a pH between 6.3 and 7.5. Plants tend to perform better in slightly acidic soils. Tarragon will not tolerate wet soil and requires only 300 to 1300 mm of rainfall annually.

## Propagation

Tarragon is usually vegetatively propagated from stem or rhizome cuttings. Stem cuttings should be 15 cm (6 in) in length and taken from the shoot tip. Use of a rooting hormone will aid tarragon rooting. Root cuttings should be 5 cm (2 in) in length and should be taken together with a new shoot. Beds should be prepared for planting by incorporating organic matter and an all purpose fertilizer, if desired,  into the soil. This should be worked into the top 15–20 cm (8–10 in) of the soil to provide nutrients and improve soil aeration. Tarrago should be planted in Spring after all danger of frost and newly rooted plants should be planted 25 cm (10 in)  apart allowing 25–40 cm (10–16 in) between rows.

General care and maintenance

In commercial tarragon production, it is common to mulch fresh plantings with straw to conserve moisture in the soil, suppress weeds and lower the soil temperature. Tarragon roots are tender and this helps them to establish in the soil. Tarragon should be watered regularly bu soil should be allowed to dry out between irrigations. Plants do not require the addition of any fertilizer as the flavor is improved by growing in nutrient poor soil. Tarragon should be pruned regularly to promote branching.

### Harvesting

In the home garden, sprigs of tarragon can be harvested as required by pinching 1/3 of the length of the stem. Commercially produced tarragon is first harvested about 2 months after transplanting when the plants are well established. Plants are harvested 2–3 times over the growing season by cutting the tender tops.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Tarragon rust Puccinia dracunculina

- Symptoms: Yellow or white spots on underside of leaves; bright orange or yellow pustules on underside of leaves; leaves may turn yellow; growth is stunted and plant may become stunted

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Spread of disease favored by poor air circulation around plants; spres are transmitted by wind

- Management: Management Remove all crop debris andd infected leaves; avoid the use of oveerheadd irrigation or water in the morrning to allow plant foliage to dry durring the day; ensure plants are well spaced to promote good air circulatioon around plants


# Tea

## Description

Tea, Camellia sinensis, is a tree or small shrub in the family Theaceae grown for its leaves which are used to make beverages. The tea plant is branching with alternate elliptical leaves. The leaves are leathery in texture, matte green in color and have serrated edges. The tea plant can take the form of a tree with a bowl-shaped canopy but is usually pruned under cultivation to be smaller and shrub-like. The plant produces fragrant white flower singly or in small clusters. Tea tree can reach up to 15 m (49 ft) in height and can live anywhere between 30 and 50 years. The plant originates from China.

## Uses

Tea leaves are usually infused with boiling water to produce an infused drink. In China, most tea leaves are processed for green tea (little or no fermentation of the leaves) whereas most Assam tea is processed for black tea which is manufactured by fermenting and crushing the leaves.Basic requirements

Tea grows best in warm and humid climates. It will tolerate temperatures between 14 and 27°C (57.2–80.6°F) with 18–20°C (64.4–68°F) being optimum. Tea plants will not tolerate frost and mean temperatures should not fall below 13°C (55.4°F) or exceed 29°C (84.2°F). Tea grows optimally in deep, well-draining, tropical red soils with an acidic pH between 4.5 and 6.0. Tea requires an average annual rainfall of 1600 mm per year distributed evenly throughout the growing season. In growing regions that experience a long dry season, tea plants require shading to increase the humidity around the plants.

## Propagation

Tea is propagated from seed or rooted leaf cuttings. Good quality seeds are selected by immersing in water for 30 minutes and selecting the seeds which sink. Seeds are commonly germinated by placing them between wet cloths. Seeds which successfully germinate are transferred to a nursery bed to grow for 2–3 years. Before transplanting to the field, the plants are cut back to a height of 15 cm (6.0 in). Leaf cuttings are also used to establish new tea plantations. Single node cuttings are taken from the desired variety and rooted in polyethylene bags containing soil by firmly pressing the stem into the soil. The bags are then placed in a shaded area and watered regularly. New tea plants produced from rooted cuttings are usually planted out in the field after 6–9 months. Tea can be planted as single rows, double rows or as a hedge. Plantations established on slopes are planted on contour rows. Seedlings or cuttings are usually planted 60 cm (24 in) apart, allowing 1.5 m (5 ft) between rows.   The tea plants are often interplanted with legumes or grasses to conserve soil moisture and prevent soil erosion. Shade trees are utilized in tea plantations grown at lower altitudes.

General care and maintenance

Newly planted tea plantations must be kept free from weeds while the tea plants establish. Weeding should be done by hand until the canopy closes and shades out weeds. Tea plants should be pruned to encourage the production of lateral branches. Busjes are shaped by tipping and thinning of branches to create the desired shape. Pruning should be maintained throughout the life of the plantation to keep the plants a manageable size and maintain productivity. pruning is best carried out when the plants are dormant where possible. If trees do not have a dormant period then they should be pruned in winter or after the dry period depending on geographic location. The tree clippings can be left in the centers of the rows to acts as an organic mulch. Tea plantations are usually fertilized 2–3 times per year. The amount of each nutrient added to the soil will depend on the soil’s own deficiencies and should ideally be based on the results of soil testing or by testing the leaves for nutrient deficiencies.

### Harvesting

Tea is harvested by “plucking” which involves the removal of the youngest leaves at the shoot terminals. The terminal bud is removed along with the two leaves directly below (fine plucking) or the bud and three leaves (coarse plucking). The younger leaves have the best flavor and removing three leaves increases production but diminishes the overall quality by including an older leaf. Tea plants are plucked by hand by grasping the plant between thumb and forefinger and is usually carried out every 7–14 days depending on altitude.

# Teff

## Description

Teff, Eragrostis tef, is a warm season annual grass in the family Poaceae grown for its grain which can be ground into flour. The teff plant characteristically possesses a large crown and many tillers (lateral offshoots originating from the base of the stem). The plant is fine stemmed and grows in tufts. It produces a panicle (a branched flower cluster) with spikelets that hold the grain. The panicle can possess 190 to  1410 spikelets and can be either compact or loose in form. The teff grain ranges in colour from white to brown or reddish purple and is very small in size (1.0-1.7 mm in length). The plant produces 2-12 white or dark brown flowers on the spikelets. Teff is an annual plant, harvested after one growing season and it can grow 25-135 cm in height depending on the cultivar. Teff may also be referred to as Tef, Xaafii, lovegrass, annual bunch grass or warm season annual bunch grass and it originates from Ethiopia.

## Uses

Teff is grown predominantly as a cereal crop in Ethiopia. The grain can be used to make flour or porridge or can be fermented and made into type of flatbread called injera, which is eaten widely in Ethiopia. Grain can also be used to brew alcoholic beverages or grown as a forage for livestock or for use in building construction. As the grain lacks gluten, it can be used to produce gluten-free specialty products for people with allergies to gluten.Basic requirements

Teff is a warm season annual and can can be grown in a wide range of climates and soil as it will tolerate both drought conditions and and waterlogging. If the soil is waterlogged it is generally preferred to grow the crop on a raised seed bed to help drainage. The crop can be grown at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 27°C in areas with an average annual rainfall of 450–550 mm, requiring 450–550 mm during the growing season. Teff plants are sensitive to daylength and optimal flowering is reached with a daylength of 12 hours.

## Propagation

Teff is grown directly from seed in a prepared seed bed. The field is prepared for planting by plowing several times and, in areas where drainage is poor, furrows or raised beds are created to aid drainage. In moisture-stressed fields, the seedbeds are tightly packed prior to sowing seed to help prevent the soil surface drying too quickly and minimize the effect of low moisture on germination Teff seeds are usually sown on the soil surface and left uncovered or are covered lightly with tree branches. Seeding rates vary by region but generally, 15–55 kg of seeds are sown per hectare of land. If seeds are sown mechanically with a broadcaster or seed drill, lower seeding rates can be used. Higher seeding rates are required when hand sowing teff seed due to the small size of the seeds making it difficult to broadcast evenly.

General care and maintenance

Teff should be grown in a weed-free field for best results. Preparing the bed by plowing prior to planting the seeds will help to destroy existing weeds. If weeds begin to grow during the growing season the field may be hand weeded 25–30 days after teff emergence, when the plants reach the early tillering stage. If weeds continue to be a problem then a second hand weeding can be carried out when teff reaches the stem elongation stage. Weeding after heading is not recommended. Teff can be fertilized to promote good production. Fertilizer can be safely applied at the same time as seed is sown without adversely affecting germination. Addition of nitrogen to the soil promotes vegetative growth of teff, while phosphorus applications will promote grain, production. potassium has been found to be of little importance for the growth of teff.

### Harvesting

Teff is ready for harvest between 60 and 120 days after planting when the leaves of the plants turn from green to yellow in color. Prompt harvest before the plants dry out completely helps to prevent the seedheads from shattering, reducing losses. At harvest, care must be taken to ensure that the grain does not get mixed with soil as the small grain size makes it impossible to separate back out. The seed is separated from the chaff by trampling or threshing.

# Thyme

## Description

Thyme, Thymus vulgaris, is a small, perennial, evergreen shrub in the family Lamiaceae grown primarily for its leaves which are used as a herb. The thyme plant has an erect or ascending growth habit and possesses many woody, branching stems. The leaves of the thyme plant are linear or elliptical and are arranged alternately on the stems. The leaves are densely covered in minute hairs and have numerous red-brown oil glands on the surface which take the appearance of small dots. The leaves can be green or variegated. The plant produces whorls of tiny pink, lilac or pale purple flowers on a terminal spike and tiny brown fruits, each with one seed. Thyme can reach a height of up to 50 cm (20 in) and can be grown as an annual or a perennial. Thyme may also be referred to as common or garden thyme and originates from the Mediterranean.

## Uses

Thyme leaves and flowers can be used fresh or dried as a herb in cooking. Bees which collect nectar from thyme flowers produce a high quality honey. Essential oil can be extracted from the leaves and is commonly used in the manufacture of perfume or as flavoring in toothpastes.Basic requirements

Thyme grows best in warm, sunny climates at temperatures between 4 and 28°C (39.2–82.4°F) but will grow best at 16°C (60.8°F). Established plants can survive temperatures down to -16°C (3.2°F). Thyme is tolerant of drought conditions but water-logged soil is detrimental to it’s survival and production. Thyme will grow best in well-draining, fertile sandy loam or sand. Thyme should be planted in alkaline soils and require full sunlight for optimum productivity.

## Propagation

Thyme is propagated from seed and can be direct seeded or sown in a nursery to produce transplants. Thyme can also be propagates from cuttings, air layering or by division of the roots. When planting seeds, they should be covered should be covered with a thin layer of soil to prevent them from drying out while they germinate. Seedlings should be thinned to a final spacing of 10–15 cm (4–6 in) allowing 20–25 cm (8–10 in) between rows. Transplants can be planted in the field after hardening when they are 5–8 cm (2–3 in) tall.  Cuttings should be taken from healthy, vigorous plants by taking a clipping about 7.6 cm (3 in) in length from the end of a branch. The leaves should be removed from the lower half of the cutting before planting in light textured potting media to root. The cutting should be watered regularly and kept moist, but not wet while they root. The new plants will be ready for transplanting after approximately 8 weeks. after hardening and are planted in the same way as seed-grown transplants.

General care and maintenance

It is common practice to mulch thyme plants with a layer of limestone gravel to suppress weeds, conserve soil moisture, improve drainage around the plant crown and reflect light back to the foliage. Once planted, thyme will grow adequately without fertilization, but will benefit from the occasional application of well aged manure or a balanced fertilizer. Similarly, thyme can withstand drought but will benefit from supplemental irrigation during dry periods. The soil should be allowed to dry out between waterings. Thyme plants should be pruned regularly by pinching off the tips of the shoots to promote branching.

### Harvesting

Thyme is best harvested just prior to flowering when the essential oil content of the leaves is at its highest. Plants can also be harvested during flowering but the flowers are very attractive to bees and this may make harvesting more problematic at this time. Thyme is harvested by cutting the branches 8–10 cm (3–4 in) above the ground. Cutting can be done by hand or, in the case of commercial production, by machine.

- Management: Management Remove and destroy infected leaves; use wide plant spacing to promote air circulation around foliage


# Tobacco

## Description

Tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum, is an herbaceous annual or perennial plant in the family Solanaceae grown for its leaves. The tobacco plant has a thick, hairy stem and large, simple leaves which are oval in shape. The tobacco plant produces white, cream, pink or red flowers which grow in large clusters, are tubular in appearance and can reach 3.5-5.5 cm (1,25-2 in) in length. Tobacco may reach 1.2-1.8 m (4-6 ft) in height and as is usually grown as an annual, surviving only one growing season. Tobacco may also be referred to as Virginia tobacco or cultivated tobacco and originates from South America.

## Uses

Tobacco is a stimulant and the dried leaves of the tobacco plant can be cured and used to produces tobacco cigarettes, cigars and snuff or for pesticide production.Basic requirements

Tobacco grows very well in a wide range of climates and will grow optimally at temperatures between 20 and 30°C (68–86°F) in areas where there is a dry period to facilitate harvest of the leaves. The type of soil depends on the variety of tobacco being grown but the best yields are usually obtained in loam to sandy loam soils. The soil should have a pH between 5.0 and 6-6. Tobacco plants are easily damaged by waterlogged soils and quality can be affected by high salinity. Plants should therefore be grown in a well draining and well aerated soil.

## Propagation

Tobacco is propagated from seed on protected (covered) seed beds or in the glasshouse and transplanted to the final growing site. Seeds grown outdoors are protected for the first few weeks to prevent weather damage to the emerging young plants. seedlings are transplanted after 30–60 days when they are approximately 15 cm (6 in) in height. The young plants should be spaced 46–61 cm (18-24 in) apart.

General care and maintenance

The best quality tobacco leaves are produced when the the flowerheads of the plants are removed, a process known as topping. Topping plants promotes the development of suckers which should also be removed. Suckers are removed through the use of chemicals in commercial tobacco production with some hand removal also necessary. Fertilizer and irrigation requirements of tobacco vary with the variety being grown but generally, tobacco has a requirement of 40-80 kg per hectare of nitrogen, 80-90 kg per hectare of phosphorous and 50-110 kg per hectare of potassium.

### Harvesting

Tobacco is harvested by hand in most parts of the world by picking 2–3 leaves from each plant per harvest. In the USA and Canada, tobacco plants are mechanically harvested by cutting the stalks of the plants. Only fully mature leaves should be harvested when hand picking is practices and harvests should be carried out at weekly intervals. After harvest, leaves are usually tied in pairs to cure.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Alternaria leaf spot (Brown spot) Alternaria alternata

- Symptoms: Small, circular, target-like spots on lower leaves; lesions are usually surrounded by a bright yellow halo; lesions enlarge and coalesce; centers of lesions dry out and drop from leaf giving foliage a ragged appearance; if variety of tobacco being grown is susceptible to the disease then spots may also appear on stalks and suckers; if spots girdle stems then the plant may be killed.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors warm, wet weather; excessive fertilization can cause greater crop losses.

- Management: Management Rotating crop away from tobacco can help to reduce the levels of inoculum in a field; stalks and roots left after harvest should be removed and destroyed; control nematodes in the soil; ensure plants have adequate potassium available to promote vigorous growth.

#### Blue mold Peronospora tabacina

- Symptoms: Circular patch of seedlings developing yellow leaves; seedlings in center may have leaves that have curled into a cup shape; fluffy blue spores developing on underside of leaves; distorted leaves; yellow lesions on leaves which may have blue mold growing on them.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors cool, wet conditions.

- Management: Management Avoid over fertilizing tobacco crop and the use of overhead irrigation which created favorable conditions for the development of the fungus; applications of appropriate protective fungicides is usually necessary to control the disease in temperate and subtropical areas.

#### Frogeye leaf spot Cercospora nicotianae

- Symptoms: The pathogen infects all stages of crop (even after the leaves are harvested). Initially the lower leaves exhibit brown, round lesions which resembles frog- eye shape (generally of 2 -15 mm in diameter) with grayish center. The disease spreads upwards. Under favorable condition lesions may coalesce to become bigger lesions resulting in drying of leaves. Also we can see black dots (spores) in the centre of this lesions.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: The disease is favored by wet weather conditions. The pathogen is more prevalent in Taiwan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Central America and India.

- Management: Management Remove and burn the infected leaves. Follow crop rotation. Keep the field free from weeds. Follow proper crop density. If the disease is severe apply suitable fungicides.

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Black shank Phytophthora parasitica

- Symptoms: Rapid yellowing and wilting of the plant proceeds plant death; dark brown to black sunken lesion is usually present on the stalk of the plant close to the soil line; lesion may extent up the stalk turning it black; splitting open stalks reveals darkened pith in discrete discs.

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Disease emergence favors poorly drained soil and warm weather.

- Management: Management Rotating the crop away from tobacco for at least one year will help to reduce levels of inoculum; plant tobacco varieties that have some degree of resistance to the disease; apply appropriate fungicides to the soil; plant tobacco in well draining soils; destroy stalks and roots immediately after harvest to reduce overwintering sites for the pathogen; control nematodes in the soil.

### Disease Category: Other

#### Broomrape Orobanche cernua Orobanche ramosa

- Symptoms: Broomrape is an complete root parasite which lacks chlorophyll and conspicuous leaves. Generally the weed shoots emerge near the tobacco plants in cluster and there roots were attached to tobacco roots to extract nutrients and water. The infested plants become weak, stunted with pale leaves. Eventually the whole plant may wilt.

- Cause: Weed

- Comments: It will cause 30 to 70% yield loss depends on severity of infestation. Broomrape also attacks on tomato, okra, eggplant etc.

- Management: Management Deep summer ploughing helps in exposing weed seeds to sunlight and reduce weed population. Remove the emerged weeds before flowering and burn them (hand weeding). Rotating the crop with sorghum, black gram etc., to reduce weed population.

### Disease Category: Fungal, Oomycete

#### Collar rot Sclerotinia sclerotiorum

- Symptoms: Water-soaked, soft, green, lesion at base of stem; white mycelium present on lesion; black fungal structures developing out of the white fungal growth.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Serious disease of glasshouse grown tobacco plants.

- Management: Management Reduce build-up of moisture in glasshouses by increasing ventilation and air circulation; increase frequency of leaf clipping and reduce the amount of leaves removed at each clipping; avoid injury to seedlings.

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Granville wilt Ralstonia solanacearum

- Symptoms: Wilting on one side of the plant; entire plant begins to wilt and plant usually dies; if plant does not die then growth is usually stunted with twisted and distorted leaves; the stalk of the plant turns black, especially at the soil line.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: The disease is most damaging in fields where tobacco has been grown the previous year and in wet areas of fields; bacterium can also colonize other Solanaceous crops such as tomato, pepper and eggplant as well as several weed species.

- Management: Management One of the most important management strategies for Granville wilt is crop rotation as the bacteria that cause the disease do not survive well in the absence of the tobacco host plant; a rotation away from tobacco for as little as one year is highly beneficial; some tobacco varieties are more susceptible to the disease than others, although none are completely immune, and should be grown when the disease is of concern; all tobacco crop debris should be removed and destroyed following harvest to reduce inoculum levels.

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Tobacco Leaf Curl disease Tobacco Leaf Curl Virus (TLCV) Begomovirus

- Symptoms: The infected plants are stunted with twisted stem ; leaves become small, curled, twisted and puckered. The veins of infected leaves may become thickening or show enations.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: The virus is transmitted by whiteflies Bemisia tabaci .

- Management: Management Use available resistant varieties. Controlling the whiteflies will reduce the virus spread- use yellow sticky traps or cover the tobacco seedling /nursery with nylon nets or growing barrier crops (like sunflower etc.,) around the nursery may reduce the white fly population.

#### Tobacco mosaic Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)

- Symptoms: Alternating light and dark green patches on the leaves; leaves turning brown and drying out.

# Tomato

## Description

Tomato is an herbaceous annual in the family Solanaceae grown for its edible fruit. The plant can be erect with short stems or vine-like with long, spreading stems.

The stems are covered in coarse hairs and the leaves are arranged spirally. The tomato plant produces yellow flowers, which can develop into a cyme of 3–12, and usually, a round fruit (berry) that is fleshy, smoothed skin, and can be red, pink, purple, brown, orange, or yellow in color.

The tomato plant can grow 0.7–2 m (2.3–6.6 ft) in height and as an annual, is harvested after only one growing season. Tomato may also be referred to as the love apple and originates from South America.

Tomatoes are native to South and Central America, but they are now grown all over the world.

Tomatoes are one of Africa's most widely grown vegetable crops. They are grown for home consumption in almost every homestead's backyard across Sub-Saharan Africa.

They are a good source of vitamins as well as a cash crop for smallholders and medium-scale commercial farmers. Tomatoes used as flavor enhancers in food are always in high demand, both fresh and processed.

### Crop Details

Scientific Name: Lycopersicon esculentum

Common Name: Nyanya (Swahili) Inyanya (luhya)

## Uses & Benefits

Tomato fruit can be eaten raw or cooked and is used in many dishes. The fruit may also be processed into juice, soup, ketchup, puree, paste or powder.

## Varieties

Tomatoes are classified into two types based on plant habit: determinate and indeterminate. Determinate (and semi-determinate) varieties have flower clusters at the end of their stems. The determinate is shorter and bushier, whereas the semi-determinate is taller. Indeterminate varieties produce new leaves and flowers all the time and can grow very tall. Indeterminate varieties bear fruit for a longer period of time. Indeterminate varieties must be staked and pruned and require more labor.

a).Roma tomato variety

They are also referred to as a paste tomato Paste tomatoes, like roma tomatoes, have a thicker fruit wall, fewer seeds, and a denser but grainier flesh.

Roma tomatoes are oblong in shape and large for their size. They are also firmer than non-roma or paste tomatoes.

They are determinate in the sense that they ripen all of sudden in place of at some stage in the season. While they can be consumed raw, they are at their best when cooked.

b). Anna F1 tomato variety

These varieties produce very high yields, require less labor, and are relatively resistant to tomato diseases. It's a fresh market tomato variety that grows best in a greenhouse. It's an oval-shaped, deep-red fruits.

It is one of Kenya's tomato varieties resistant to Alternaria stem canker, nematodes, and Fusarium wilt.

This variety matures quickly, relatively seventy-five days after transplanting. Its maturity period is determined by the weather.

The first harvest of Anna F1 yields less than later harvests, as with most tomato varieties in Kenya. Anna F1 produces an average of 74 tons of tomatoes per acre and 35 kg per tomato plant.

### c). Bingo

Bingo is a large-fruited Heirloom Tomato Seed is widely adapted to a wide range of growing conditions and consistently produces large, smooth fruit. To protect the fruit from sunburn, the plant grows a dense canopy of leaves.

### d). Plum

A plum tomato, also known as a processing tomato or paste tomato, is a tomato variety bred for sauce and packing.

They are typically oval or cylindrical in shape, with fewer locules than standard round tomatoes and a higher solid content, making them more suitable for processing.

e). Cherry tomato

The cherry tomato is a small round tomato that comes in red, yellow, green, and black colors. Since they're naturally sweet, they are typically eaten raw in salads.

## Propagation

### Basic Requirements

For high yield and premium quality, tomatoes prefer a relatively cool, dry climate. It is, however, adaptable to a wide range of climatic conditions. Tomatoes have been grown as far north (under protection) as the Arctic Circle and as far south as the hot and humid equator. Temperatures between 21 and 24°C are ideal for growth and development. Prolonged exposure to temperatures below 12°C can result in chilling. Temperatures above 27°C have a negative impact on growth and fruit set.

Pollen and egg cells are destroyed when the maximum daytime temperature is 38°C or higher for 5 to 10 days. Fruit set is also generally poor when night temperatures exceed 21°C just before and after flower formation. Flower abortion can also be caused by hot, dry winds.

Tomatoes are not affected by day length and can produce fruit in photoperiods ranging from 7 to 19 hours. Tomatoes can be grown in a variety of soil types, from sandy loam to clay-loam soils rich in organic matter. The ideal pH range for soil is 6 to 6.5; higher or lower pH can result in mineral deficiencies or toxicities. Flooding for extended periods is harmful to tomato growth and development.

### Growing from Seed

Tomatoes can be direct-seeded or transplanted in the field, but this method is costly because large amounts of seed are required (about 500 to 1000 g of seeds/ha) and four weeks of weeding labor is added to the growing costs.

Growing young transplants in a special nursery, on the other hand, allows growers to achieve high seedling uniformity while using less seed and saving money on weeding.

Nursery bed preparation:

### General Care and Maintenance

Tomatoes respond well to liberal applications of well-rotted compost or manure. A spoonful (or three teaspoons) of rock phosphate should also be added to each planting hole. If the soil is deficient in organic matter, it is best to grow a crop of high-quality green manure like cowpeas, mucuna, soybeans, or crotalaria before transplanting tomato seedlings.

Avoid commercial nitrogen fertilizers because too much nitrogen causes fruit puffiness and blossom-end rot, as well as excessive vegetative growth. Excess free nitrogen in the soil softens the leaves and makes the plants more appealing to pests and diseases. Weed competition can be fierce, especially in the hot and humid tropics.

Slash emerging weeds as close to the ground as possible between rows of tomatoes to control weeds on open land crops. Leave slashed weeds as mulch on the soil to help prevent erosion, lower soil temperature, and conserve soil moisture. This should be supplemented by manual weeding in rows and straw mulching of the beds.

For tall growing indeterminate varieties, firmly plant a 2 m stake in the ground for each tomato plant and loosely tie the stems as the plant grows. Alternatively, place a sturdy pole in the ground every four meters and run two wires - one at 2 meters and another at 0.15 meters above the ground. Connect the two wires behind each tomato plant with a fairly strong string. As the plants grow, they can be carefully twisted around the strings.

For indeterminate tomato varieties, pruning is required. On a weekly basis, one or two main stems should be allowed to grow and the side branches (laterals) should be pinched off as the crop grows. When 6 to 8 flower clusters form, the growing top should be pinched off to promote the development of large marketable fruit.

Remove any leaves that are close to the ground to help prevent blight infection. On determinate cultivars, there is no pruning and no regulation of fruit number and clusters. Semi-determinate cultivars can be grown as both a determinate and an indeterminate crop.

To avoid spreading tobacco mosaic virus disease, smokers should thoroughly wash their hands with soap before handling tomato plants. Tomatoes require adequate irrigation during the early stages of plant growth, fruit set, and fruit enlargement.

The consistency of water supply to the plants is critical in achieving uniform maturity. It also reduces the occurrence of blossom-end rot, a physiological disorder caused by a lack of calcium during fruit enlargement. Watering is required at least twice a week in dry weather. Because it does not cause water splashes on the plants, drip irrigation is the most efficient and risk-free method of irrigation.

Although indeterminate, cherry tomatoes can produce quite well even when not staked in the field, but they must be given adequate space because they spread quite widely (one m2 per plant is recommended). Higher output and easier field management are advantages of the costly staking procedure.

### Harvesting

Before being marketed, fresh-market tomatoes are frequently harvested at the mature-green stage and ripened in transit or storage. Ethylene is sometimes used to quickly and uniformly ripen mature-green tomatoes before shipping them to market, but this has a negative impact on quality. In Kenya, this is not a common practice. Pre-ripe tomatoes are generally of lower quality (lower soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and reducing sugars) than plant-ripened tomatoes.

Fresh-market tomato cultivars' growth and ripening patterns necessitate frequent pickings for either mature-green or plant-ripe fruits. Processing tomatoes, as opposed to fresh market or table tomatoes, are picked fully ripe. Harvesting is often done by machine in developed countries. Tomatoes used in pureed products such as soup, juice, and sauces are grown until more than 85% of the fruits are ripe. Those for whole tomatoes are picked while still firm, but only about 65% of the crop may be ready at once.

To prepare tomatoes for market, store them in a shady location, either in the field or at home, after picking. The marketable fruits are then packaged in appropriate containers, which are typically 20-kg wooden boxes, bamboo baskets, plastic boxes, or other locally available packaging materials.

Proper packaging protects the fruits and reduces water loss. Tomato storage life is determined by the maturity stage at which they are harvested as well as the desired fruit quality. Quality is highest when fully ripe, whether artificially or naturally. To ripen properly, mature-green tomatoes should be stored for 7 to 10 days at 13 to 18°C and 85 to 90% RH.

The single most important visual parameter of tomato quality is color. Lycopene development is generally poor at temperatures above 30°C. This is the primary reason that tomatoes grown in the hot tropics have a pale red or yellowish color and are bland in flavor.

Cherry tomato harvesting and packaging are determined by market demand. Fruit clusters can be cut for distant markets when the fruits turn red or pink, depending on the cultivar. For the domestic market, firm red ripe fruits are required. However, cherry tomatoes for the export market are graded and packaged into pre-packs before being shipped directly to supermarkets in the export destinations.

A marketable yield of 20 tons/ha or higher is considered a good yield. Under experimental conditions at KALRO, Thika Horticultural Research Station, yields of up to 60 tons/ha have been obtained.

When harvesting tomatoes for seed, pick ripe fruit from only robust, disease- free plants (plants free of bacterial canker, bacterial speck, bacterial spot, anthracnose fruit rot, early blight, late blight, and tomato mosaic virus). Wash the fruit, preferably with a potassium-based soap, to reduce the risk of disease infection. Cut the fruit in half and scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Alternatively, squeeze the pieces into a clean bucket, plastic, glass, or ceramic bowl until only the seed-jelly and fruit sap remain. Cover the bowl with a cloth or paper to keep dirt and other contaminants out, but don't make it airtight. Allow the seeds to sit for 1 to 5 days (usually 2 to 3 days in warm areas).

If seeds cannot be sown right away, they should be stored in a waterproof container (transparent plastic bag / clear glass bottle). Transparent materials allow sunlight in, reducing mould growth. Put some ashes in the bottom of the container to absorb moisture and keep the seeds from moulding. When storing seeds in pots or bottles, the tops should be covered with plastic film to prevent water seepage and mite infestation. Keep the seed container in a cool, dry location. Check the seeds for mould development on a regular (at least weekly) basis. If mould is found, the seeds should be dried again. Seeds can be stored for up to two years if properly dried. One kg of tomatoes produces between 1 and 4 grams of seeds.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose Colletotrichum coccodes

- Symptoms: Fruit symptoms are the most common although stem, leaves and roots can also be infected; disease causes characteristic sunken circular lesions on the fruit; the indentations on may have visible concentric brown and yellow rings; lesion centers turn tan in color as they mature and become dotted with small black fungal fruiting bodies (microsclerotia); lesions can grow very large

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors warm weather; appears early in the spring

- Management: Management Avoid sprinkler irrigation when fruit is ripening; rotate crops with other non-solanaceous plants

#### Black mold Alternaria alternata

- Symptoms: Disease causes the appearance of black or brown lesions on the surface of ripe fruit; lesions may be tiny flecks or may be large patches of decaying tissue; during periods of humid weather, the lesions may become covered in black, velvety spore masses.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease is found wherever tomatoes are grown; ripe fruit become increasingly susceptible to the fungus the longer they stay on the vine after ripening.

- Management: Management Cultural control methods such as avoiding wetting the foliage when watering and harvesting fruits as soon as they are ripe can help to reduce the incidence of the disease; in areas where disease is a persistent problem, chemical control may be necessary with an appropriate fungicide; fungicide is usually applied 4-6 weeks prior to the first anticipated fruit harvest.

#### Early blight Alternaria solani

- Symptoms: Early blight symptoms start as oval shaped lesions with a yellow chlorotic region across the lesion; concentric leaf lesions may be seen on infected leaves; leaf tissue between veins is destroyed; severe infections can cause leaves to completely collapse; as the disease progresses leaves become severely blighted leading to reduced yield; tomato stems may become infected with the fungus leading to Alternaria stem canker; initial symptoms of of stem canker are the development of dark brown regions on the stem; stem cankers may enlarge to girdle the whole stem resulting in the death of the whole plant; brown streaks can be found in the vascular tissue above and below the canker region; fruit symptoms include small black v-shaped lesions at the shoulders of the fruit (the disease is also known black shoulder); lesions may also appear on the fruit as dark flecks with concentric ring pattern; fruit lesions can seen in the field or may develop during fruit transit to the market; the lesions may have a velvety appearance caused by sporulation of the fungus

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease can spread rapidly after plants have set fruit; movement of air-borne spores and contact with infested soil are causes for the spread of the disease

- Management: Management Apply appropriate fungicide at first sign of disease; destroy any volunteer solanaceous plants (tomato, potato, nightshade etc); practice crop rotation

#### Fusarium wilt Fusarium oxysporum

- Symptoms: Symptoms of Fusarium wilt may first appear as yellowing and wilting of leaves on one side of the leaf midrib or plant; one-sided symptoms are caused by a blockage in the vascular system supplying the symptomatic side of the plant; as the disease progresses, older leaves become necrotic and the plant begins to wilt; fruit on infected plants is smaller and yield is reduced; damage to leaves makes fruit susceptible to sunscald; stem symptoms may be mistaken for bacterial wilt but a bacterial ooze test will be negative; stem tissue becomes discolored brown

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors warm, moist soil Fusarium wilt is not a major issue in tomato production, however, the disease can still cause minor losses

- Management: Management Plant resistant varieties; sanitize all equipment regularly; control root knot nematodes; rotate crops away from tomato for several years

#### Gray mold (Botrytis blight) Botrytis cinerea

- Symptoms: Disease appears on tomato seedlings at or just below the soil line as a fuzzy gray-brown lesion which often girdles the stem, if stem is girdled all parts of the plant above the lesion begin to wilt; infected flowers and calyxes become covered in gray spores; unripe fruit turns light brown or gray in color and rots; green fruit infected by airborne spores develop circular white rings called “ghost spots”.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Gray mold is usually associated with wounds on plants; can develop in relatively cool conditions.

- Management: Management Liming soil to increase calcium content can help to reduce plant susceptibility to gray mold; application of appropriate fungicide prior to formation of dense canopy.

#### Leaf Mold Passalora fulva

- Symptoms: The older leaves exhibit pale greenish to yellow spots (without distinguishable margins) on upper surface. Whereas the lower portion of this spots exhibit green to brown velvety fungal growth. As the disease progress the spots may coalesce and appear brown. The infected leaves become wither and die but stay attached to the plant. The fungus also infects flowers and fruits. The affected flowers become black and drop off. The affected fruit intially shows smooth black irregular area on the stem end but later it becomes sunken, leathery and dry.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: The disease is favored by high relative humidity. Also a common disease in green house tomato crop.

- Management: Management Grow available resistant varieties. Avoid leaf wetting and overhead application of water. Follow proper spacing to provide good air circulation around the plants. Remove the infected plant debris and burn them. If the disease is severe scary suitable fungicide.

#### Septoria leaf spot Septoria lycopersici

- Symptoms: Symptoms may occur at any stage of tomato development and begin as small, water-soaked spots or circular grayish-white spots on the underside of older leaves; spots have a grayish center and a dark margin and they may colasece; fungal fruiting bodies are visible as tiny black specks in the center of spot; spots may also appear on stems, fruit calyxes, and flowers.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Spread by water splash; fungus overwinters in plant debris.

- Management: Management Ensure all tomato crop debris is removed and destroyed in Fall or plowed deep into soil; plant only disease-free material; avoid overhead irrigation; stake plants to increase air circulation through the foliage; apply appropriate fungicide if necessary.

#### Target Spot Corynespora cassiicola

- Symptoms: The fungus infects all parts of plant. Infected leaves shows small, pinpoint, water soaked spots initially. As the disease progress the spots enlarge to become necrotic lesions with conspicuous concentric circles, dark margins and light brown centers. Whereas the fruits exhibit brown, slightly sunken flecks in the beginning but later the lesions become large pitted appearance.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: The pathogen infects cucumber, pawpaw , ornamental plants, some weed species etc. The damaged fruits are susceptible for this disease.

- Management: Management Remove the plant debris and burn them. Avoid over application of nitrogen fertilizer. If the disease is severe spray suitable fungicides.

#### Verticillium wilt Verticillium albo-atrum Verticillium dahliae

- Symptoms: Symptoms appear first on lower leaves and spread upwards; initial symptoms of the disease may be visible as yellow blotches on the lower leaves of the plant; a rapid yellowing of leaves follows as the disease progresses; leaf veins turn brown and brown dead spots appear on the leaves; leaves may wilt then die and drop from the plant; the disease progresses upwards through the stem causing the plant to be stunted; leaves at the top of the plant remain green; fruits develop yellow shoulders and yield is reduced; loss of leaves results in fruit being susceptible to sun scald.

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Fungi survive in crop debris in soil; disease emergence favors cool weather.

- Management: Management Plant resistant varieties; sanitize all equipment on a regular basis; rotate with non-susceptible crops.

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Bacterial canker Clavibacter michiganensis

- Symptoms: Bacterial canker can affect tomato plants of any age, seedlings may be killed quickly once they become infected; initial symptoms of bacterial canker is the unilateral wilting of plants and formation of light colored streaks up and down the outside of the leaf midrib, petiole and stem; streaks on stems may break open to form cankers; mature leaves develop small necrotic spots on the upper leaf surfaces or small raised white spots on the leaves; white spots develop on fruit, usually while they are still green; spots on fruit develop a raised dark center and are known as "bird's eye spots"

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Can cause serious crop losses

- Management: Management Plant only certified seed and transplants; hot water treatment of seed to remove bacteria; rotate crops with non-host plants; turn crops into soil after harvest to promote decomposition

#### Bacterial speck Pseudomonas syringae

- Symptoms: Dark specks appear on the leaves, often associated with a yellow halo; foliar symptoms of bacterial speck are very difficult to distinguish from bacterial spot but can be differentiated by symptoms on the fruit; lesions on fruit are much smaller than those caused by bacterial spot; lesions on fruit are raised and scaly.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease emergence favors cool, moist weather.

- Management: Management Do not plant in same area in successive years; use only high quality, disease-free seed and transplants; protective sprays of copper can help to reduce incidence of the disease.

#### Bacterial spot Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria Xanthomonas euvesicatoria Xanthomonas perforans = [Xanthomonas axonopodis (syn. campestris) pv. vesicatoria], Xanthomonas vesicatoria Xanthomonas gardneri

- Symptoms: Bacterial spot lesions starts out as small water-soaked spots; lesions become more numerous and coalesce to form necrotic areas on the leaves giving them a blighted appearance; of leaves drop from the plant severe defoliation can occur leaving the fruit susceptible to sunscald; mature spots have a greasy appearance and may appear transparent when held up to light; centers of lesions dry up and fall out of the leaf; blighted leaves often remain attached to the plant and give it a blighted appearance; fruit infections start as a slightly raised blister; lesions may have a faint halo which eventually disappears; lesions on fruit may have a raised margin and sunken center which gives the fruit a scabby appearance.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Bacteria survive on crop debris; disease emergence favored by warm temperatures and wet weather; symptoms are very similar to other tomato diseases but only bacterial spot will cause a cut leaf to ooze bacterial exudate; the disease is spread by infected seed, wind-driven rain, diseased transplants, or infested soil; bacteria enter the plant through any natural openings on the leaves or any openings caused by injury to the leaves.

- Management: Management Use only certified seed and healthy transplants; remove all crop debris from planting area; do not use sprinkler irrigation, instead water from base of plant; rotate crops.

#### Bacterial wilt Ralstonia solanacearum

- Symptoms: Initial symptoms of the disease is the wilting of a few of the youngest leaves; the disease progresses rapidly in hot weather and the entire plant wilts suddenly and dies; in cooler conditions, wilting is less rapid and plant may produce roots on the stems; vascular tissue shows a brown discoloration and decaying roots; stems cut under water will ooze bacterial exudate and will confirm the symptoms are not caused by Fusarium wilt.

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Bacterial wilt can cause complete destruction of the crop under conditions suitable for the spread of the soil-borne bacterium; disease causes serious losses in tomatoes grown in tropical and subtropical regions.

- Management: Management Cultural practices may help to reduce incidence of the disease, rotate tomato with other, non-susceptible crops; avoid over-watering plants.

### Disease Category: Other

#### Blossom-end rot

- Symptoms: Blossom end-rot is caused by a low concentration of calcium in the tomato fruit; symptoms initially appear as light tan, water-soaked areas which can then enlarge and turn black and leathery in appearance; symptoms are most often seen at the blossom end of the fruit, but may also occur on the side of the fruit; blossom-end rot may also occur internally with no visible symptoms on outside of fruit.

- Cause: Physiological disorder.

- Comments: Low calcium may result from competition from other ions in soil e.g. potassium; can also be caused by drought stress; fluctuations in soil moisture or application of excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer which promotes rapid vegetative growth; calcium cannot be translocated from the leaves to the fruit; foliar applications of Ca materials have not proven to reduce BER, since very little Ca is taken up by the fruit; in greenhouse production not cycling the irrigation system at night can increase BER, since night is an important period of Ca uptake.

- Management: Management Maintain soil pH at 6.5; lime soil to increase the concentration of calcium in soil and decrease competition with other ions; use mulch to reduce drought stress; avoid ammonium fertilizers as they may increase competition with calcium by increasing ammonium ions in soil, use nitrate instead; avoid over fertilizing.

#### Catface

- Symptoms: Catface usually occurs on the blossom end, tomato fruits are usually misshapen with large holes or corky brown scars close to the blossom end of the fruit; fruits are often flattened and may be kidney shaped; holes on the fruit extend deep inside the fruit.

- Cause: Physiological disorder

- Comments: The catface deformity is possibly caused by internal or external changes that occurs during the formation of the flower resulting in the abnormal development of the fruit; the exact cause is unknown, there may be several factors in fruit deformation; cold weather is known to be a factor along with extreme fluctuations in temperatures between day and night; hormone based herbicides may also cause catfacing; varieties that produce large tomatoes are more prone to catfacing.

- Management: Management Avoid pruning tomato plants excessively; avoid excessive fertilization with nitrogen which promotes rapid vegetative growth; if growing tomatoes in a glasshouse, provide the plants with heat to prevent temperatures dropping to damaging levels, particularly at night.

#### Edema (Oedema)

- Symptoms: Swellings and/or blisters or calluses on leaves caused by rupturing epidermal and inner leaf cells ; deformed foliage which curls; leaf tissue may also tear as the leaf matures; symptoms are often mistaken for disease or insect damage

- Cause: Physiological disorder

- Comments: Edema occurs when water is absorbed from the soil faster than it can be transpired through the leaves and is caused by soil being warmer than the surrounding air

- Management: Management Tomato plants should always be planted in well draining soil or potting media; avoid overwatering tomato plants, particularly during periods of low light and cool temperatures; if growing tomatoes in a glasshouse then anything that can be done to increase drainage and air circulation will be helpful in preventing edema; reduce humidity in the glasshouse in the morning by venting the house (heat may need to be turned up during this period depending on outdoor temperatures)

#### Fertilizer burn

- Symptoms: Symptoms may first appear as slowed growth and wilting; leaf tips and margins turn brown; plants have a scorched appearance.

- Cause: Excess nitrogen salts

- Comments: Fertilizer burn is usually caused by an excess of nitrogen salts in the soil which causes an osmotic stress on the plant tissues. The tissues dry out and die resulting in the characteristic scorched appearance of the leaves.

- Management: Management Apply appropriate dose of fertilizer for the particular soil in which the plants are growing - nutrient requirements can be ascertained with a soil test; if liquid fertilizer was used, symptoms may be reversed by watering the plants heavily to leach some of the salts from the soil.

#### Little leaf

- Symptoms: Little leaf symptoms include interveinal chlorosis of young leaves, distortion and failure of leaves along the midrib to expand, radial cracks of fruits extending from the calyx to the blossom scar and failure of blooms to set; symptoms progress to increased leaflet distortion and more pronounced interveinal chlorosis.

- Cause: Physiological disorder

- Comments: Three conditions appear to pre-dispose plants to little leaf. 1) high soil temperatures 2) high soil moisture and 3) presence of predisposing population of bacterial/fungal microorganisms in the soil.

- Management: Management Little leaf is usually associated with water-logged areas of fields, subsequent drying out of affected areas usually resolves the problem and subsequent plant growth is normal; controlling the soil pH may also help the problem.

#### Magnesium deficiency

- Symptoms: Symptoms of magnesium deficiency appear on older leaves first; initial symptoms are interveinal chlorosis of the leaves and, occasionally, a purple tinge to the leaves; as the deficiency becomes more severe, leaves may appear white with green veins; severe deficiencies may lead to reduced fruit yield.

- Cause: Nutritional disorder

- Comments: Magnesium deficiency is rare in field grown tomatoes but occurs more frequently in soilless tomato culture.

- Management: Management Magnesium deficiency can be prevented in tomato by applying dolomite lime to the soil, if an increase in soil pH is required, or through applications of a fertilizer containing magnesium.

#### Multiple nutrients deficiency

- Symptoms:

- Cause: Nutritional disorder

- Comments: #### Nitrogen deficiency

- Symptoms: Affected plants are smaller in size and grow less vigorously than healthy plants; symptoms appear on older leaves first; tomato leaves exhibit a general yellowing occasionally accompanied by purple leaf veins; plants possess thinner stems and fruit is smaller than healthy plants; fruits may be misshapen with a lighter red color than healthy plants.

- Cause: Nutritional disorder

- Comments: Nitrogen deficiency usually arises in tomato plantations through inadequate fertilizer application; heavy rain can leach nitrogen from sandy soils.

- Management: Management If detected early, symptoms of nitrogen deficiency can be treated by applying appropriate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer.

#### Phosphorous deficiency

- Symptoms: Growth of tomato seedlings is reduced compared with healthy plants; leaves appear darker green and may have a purple tinge; in older tomato plants, leaves grow upright and appear light green on the upper surface and purple on the lower surface; symptoms appear on older leaves first.

- Cause: Nutritional disorder

- Comments: Phosphorous deficiency is rare in soils that are already used for agricultural purposes; in field grown tomatoes phosphorous deficiency more commonly appears in newly cleared land which has never been used to grow crops; phosphorus deficiency may occur on soilless tomato cultures if applications of the nutrient are inadequate.

- Management: Management Soil levels of phosphorous should be measured prior to planting to determine the appropriate application for the particular site; phosphorous should be applied to the soil prior to planting if required as applications made after the onset of tomato growth are not usually successful in preventing symptoms.

#### Potassium deficiency

- Symptoms: Affected plants are smaller than healhty plants with smaller fruits and reduced yields; tomato leaves exhibit "bronzing", older plant leaves turn tan and then brown at the margins; if deficiency is prolonged, leaves become necrotic at the margins and turn yellow between leaf veins.

- Cause: Nutritional disorder

- Comments: Potassium deficiency is usually caused by an inadequate fertilization, it is more common in sandy soils where the nutrient is easily leached from the soil by heavy rainfall.

- Management: Management Potassium deficiency can be corrected through applications of the nutrient as a side dressing and/or through an irrigation system.

#### Sunscald

- Symptoms: Symptoms of sunscald are most common on green fruit; white or yellow necrotic patches develop on the sides of the fruit that are facing the sun; blisters may be white with a yellow halo; damaged areas may become flattened in appearance and papery in texture; damaged areas are often invaded by secondary pathogens and turn black.

- Cause: Physiological disorder

- Comments: Sunscald is common on plants which have been moved suddenly from a shaded location to full sun.

- Management: Management Healthy plants with full foliage are less susceptible to sunscald as the leaves provide fruits with shading, ensure plants are watered regularly and fertilized adequately; use shade cloth to protect the fruits from the sun; control diseases that develop to prevent defoliation which can lead to sunscald.

#### Water stress

- Symptoms: Leaves are green but wilting; leaves roll downwards and eventually drop from the plant; fruits may develop symptoms of Blossom-end rot (See entry).

- Cause: Physiological stress

- Comments: It is important to distinguish between plants that are temporarily wilted on hot days and those that are stressed due to lack of moisture in the soil; on very hot days tomato plants will wilt as the rate of transpiration exceeds the rate at which water can be taken up from the soil by the roots and the plants will usually recover in the evening when temperatures are cooler.

- Management: Management Tomato plants should be watered deeply and evenly to avoid water stress; aim to keep the soil moist but not wet; allow the top of the soil to dry before watering again.

#### Zippering

- Symptoms: Thin brown scars extending longutudinally from the petiole to the blossom-end of the fruit; each scar has smaller scars crossing it tranversely rendering it zipper-like in appearance; holes may open on along the scarred area.

- Cause: Physiological disorder

- Comments: Zipper scars on tomato fruit are most prevalent in cool weather.

- Management: Management The most effective method of preventing zippering is to grow tolerant varieties; when growing tomatoes in the glasshouse, appropriate temperatures should be maintained.

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Buckeye rot (Phytophthora root rot) Phytophthora spp.

- Symptoms: Buck eye rot of tomato initially appears as a brown spot on the fruit which enlarges over the fruit surface and forms concentric rings; the lesions may eventually cover up to half of the fruit and the flesh develops a soft rot underneath the skin; green or red fruits can be affected and disease often develops where fruit is in contact with the soil; white cottony growth may be visible in the centers of affected regions; spots enlarge and form large concentric ring shaped symptoms which are usually brown in color with sunken edges; the Phytophthora pathogen also causes root rot; young plants may exhibit a white cottony growth at crown of the plant and begin to wilt as the damage to the roots progresses; Phytophthora root rot can cause severe destruction of plant roots and cause the plants to wilt completely.

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Prolonged period of warm wet conditions favor disease occurrence; heavy soil saturation also favors disease development in soils where pathogen is present; disease can be spread by splashing water.

- Management: Management Cultural control methods such as mulching around the plants and practicing rotation away from tomato can help to reduce losses from the disease; fungicides applied for the control of late blight also help to control the development of buckeye rot; solarizing or fumigating soil can help to reduce levels of inoculum.

#### Late blight Phytophthora infestans

- Symptoms: Late blight affects all aerial parts of the tomato plant; initial symptoms of the disease appear as water-soaked green to black areas on leaves which rapidly change to brown lesions; fluffy white fungal growth may appear on infected areas and leaf undersides during wet weather; as the disease progresses, foliage becomes becomes shriveled and brown and the entire plant may die; fruit lesions start as irregularly shaped water soaked regions and change to greasy spots; entire fruit may become infected and a white fuzzy growth may appear during wet weather.

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Can devastate tomato plantings.

- Management: Management Plant resistant varieties; if signs of disease are present or if rainy conditions are likely or if using overhead irrigation appropriate fungicides should be applied.

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Tomato mosaic virus Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV)

- Symptoms: Symptoms can occur at any growth stage and any part of the plant can be affected; infected leaves generally exhibit a dark green mottling or mosaic; some strains of the virus can cause yellow mottling on the leaves; young leaves may be stunted or distorted; severely infected leaves may have raised green areas; fruit yields are reduced in infected plants; green fruit may have yellow blotches or necrotic spots; dark necrotic streaks may appear on the stems, petioles leaves and fruit.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: ToMV is a closely related strain of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), it enters fields via infected weeds, peppers or potato plants; the virus may also be transmitted to tomato fields by grasshoppers, small mammals and birds.

- Management: Management Plant varieties that are resistant to the virus; heat treating seeds at 70°C (158°F) for 4 days or at 82–85°C (179.6–185°F) for 24 hours will help to eliminate any virus particles on the surface of the seeds; soaking seed for 15 min in 100 g/l of tri-sodium phosphate solution (TSP) can also eliminate virus particles - seeds should be rinsed thoroughly and laid out to dry after this treatment; if the virus is confirmed in the field, infected plants should be removed and destroyed to limit further spread; plant tomato on a 2-year rotation, avoiding susceptible crops such as peppers, eggplant, cucurbits and tobacco; disinfect all equipment when moving from infected areas of the field.

#### Tomato spotted wilt Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV)

- Symptoms: Infected plants exhibit bronzing or purpling of the upper sides of young leaves and develop necrotic spots; leaf spots may resemble those caused by bacterial spot, but a bacterial ooze test will be negative; leaves may cup downwards, shoot tips may begin to die back; symptoms on ripe fruit appear as chlorotic spots and blotches, often with concentric rings; ring spot symptoms vary with different tomato cultivars; irregular ripening caused by TSWV can also show up when fruit are treated with ethylene gas; green fruit may exhibit slightly raised areas with faint concentric zonation.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: TSWV infects numerous ornamentals, vegetables, field crops and weeds; virus is vectored by at least eight species of thrips; thrips, acquires the virus during the larval stages,and transmit the virus when they are adults.

- Management: Management Control populations of western flower thrips and onion thrips

#### Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl disease Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) family Geminiviridae, genus Begomovirus

- Symptoms: The infected leaves become reduced in size, curl upward, appear crumpled and show yellowing of veins and leaf margins. The internodes become shorter and whole plant appear stunted and bushy. The whole plant stand erect with only upright growth. The flowers may not develop and drop off.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: The virus is transmitted by white flies and may cause 100 % yield loss if the plants infect at early stage of crop. The virus also infect other hosts like common bean, ornamental plants and several weed species.

- Management: Management Grow available resistant varieties. Transplant only disease and whiteflies free seedlings. Remove the infected plants and burn them. Keep the field free from weeds. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and control whiteflies. If the insect infestation is severe spray suitable insecticides.


# Turnip

## Description

Turnip, Brassica rapa, is an herbaceous annual or biennial plant in the family Brassicaceae grown for its edible roots and leaves. The plant  possesses erect stems and 8–12 leaves forming a crown. The leaves are light green in color, hairy and thin. The plant produces light yellow flowers which are clustered at the top of a raceme and are often extended above the terminal buds. The leaves can reach 30.5–35.5 cm (12–14 in) in length, while the branching flower stems can reach 30.5–91.5 cm (12–36 in). The taproot of the plant is is a bulbous tuber, almost perfectly round, which is usually a mixture of purple, white and yellow. Turnip is usually grown as an annual and harvested after one growing season. Turnip may also be referred to as annual turnip and originates from Europe.

## Uses

Turnips are eaten as a vegetable after cooking. The shoots and leaves can be eaten fresh in salads or the entire plant can be used as a forage for livestock.Requirements

Turnips are cold hardy vegetables which can be grown early in the spring for a summer harvest or in the summer for harvesting in late fall. They prefer a fertile, well draining soil which has a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. The soil should have a loose texture for optimum root development. Turnips will grow best in full sun but will tolerate partial shade. The average daily temperature should fall between 10–18°C (50–65°F) for adequate growth.

### Planting

Turnips are usually direct seeded and can be sown as soon as the soil is workable in the Spring. For a Fall harvest, sow seeds about 2 months before the first frost in your area. Prepare the soil for planting by loosening it with a fork to a depth of about 30–38 cm (12–15 in). Remove any large rocks if present. Incorporate 2–4 inches of compost into the soil prior to planting. Sow seeds by broadcasting and raking 13 mm (0.5 in) into the soil. Thin seedlings to a final spacing of 7.5–10 cm (3–4 in). Alternatively, seeds can be sown in rows spaced 30–45 cm (12–18 in) apart.

### General care

Water turnip plants evenly and keep the soil moist for optimum growth. Mulching the plants will help to conserve moisture in the soil. Pull any weeds as they appear, the soil can be cultivated down to 2.5–5.0 cm (2–3 in) when the plants are small but this should be reduced as the plants grow larger to prevent damage to delicate feeder roots.

### Harvest

Turnip greens can be harvested from the plant when the leaves are about 10 cm (10 in) tall. If growing turnips for both greens and roots then only remove 2–3 leaves from each plant. Roots are ready to harvest when they reach 2.5–7.5 cm (1–3 in) in diameter. Small turnips can often be harvested by gently pulling from the soil by hand but larger roots in heavier soil may need gently dug up with a garden fork. Store unwashed roots in a root cellar or basement.

# Vanilla

## Description

Vanilla, Vanilla planifolia, is a fleshy perennial vine in the family Orchidaceae grown for its pods and seeds which are used as a flavoring. The vanilla plant has a long succulent stem and grows by wrapping around trees. The vine has alternate, fleshy oblong or lanceolate leaves which are rounded at the base. The plant produces flowers on short racemes, each possessing 6–15 flowers, and fruits which take the form of narrow, cylindrical pods (or beans), each possessing many small black seeds. The vanilla plant can reach a height of 10–15 m (33–49 ft) in height and has an economic lifespan of approximately 10 years. The plant is native to Central America.

## Uses

Vanilla bean extract is used a flavoring in confectionery and baking. Essential oils extracted from the plant are also used in the perfume industry.Basic requirements

Vanilla is a tropical plant and will grow best in warm, humid climates at temperatures between 21 and 32°C (33.8–89.6°F). Vanilla requires a soil rich in calcium and potassium and will grow best in a soil which is light and well-draining, with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Vanilla is a climbing plant and should always be provided with a support to grow on. It is usually planted alongside a companion tree, known as a tutor tree which has the added benefit of providing it with shade. Vanilla grows naturally in forests, often in clearings and alongside rivers and lakes where the forest canopy is thinner.

## Propagation

Vanilla is usually propagated vegetatively from stem cuttings from a mother plant which has not been allowed to flower. Cuttings are best taken during the dry season when growth of the vines is slower. A cutting of 1.5 m (5 ft) should be taken and planted at the base of the support tree after removing the lower leaves. Cuttings should be planted at least 2 m (6.6 ft) apart. If a support tree is being used, it is preferable to use a type with a high number of lower branches. Vanilla may also be grown on a trellis or support post.

General care and maintenance

Vanilla should be managed to keep the vines at a manageable height as left unchecked they will continue to grow to the crowns of the supporting trees. When the plants reach a height of 1.6–1.8 m they should be bent back over the nearest suitable branch and the end of the shoot planted back into the ground and covered with soil. Planting the end of the shoot encourages the growth of roots and the continual production of newly rooted shoots helps to maintain a healthy plantation. Shoots may also be cut at the desired height and planted next to the same tutor tree once the wound has dried to create a new rooted plant. Vanilla should be mulched with organic mulch such as grass clippings to help suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture. Vanilla will benefit from the addition of fertilizer but applications are unnecessary and are rarely made in commercial production. Vanilla is naturally pollinated by small mexican bees and, although pollination is possible if the bees are present, plants are usually hand pollinated to ensure production.

### Harvesting

Vanilla is ready for harvest between 6 and 9 months after flowering when the pods are still dark green and the tip is beginning to turn yellow.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose Colletotrichum spp.

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Emergence of the disease is favored by excessive soil moisture, too much shading of plants, inadequate fertilization, over-crowding and drought stress

- Management: Management Plant vanilla in well-draining soils and avoid overcrowding the plants; prune out infected plant parts; plant vanilla varieties that are tolerant of resistant to the disease


# Walnut

## Description

Walnut, Juglans regia, is a deciduous tree in the Family Juglandaceae grown for its edible seeds. Walnut trees are large and vigorous with a wide-spreading canopy. The trunk of the tree can reach 2 m (6.6 ft) in diameter and mature trees possess smooth, silver-gray bark. Walnut leaves are composed of an odd number of smaller, oval shaped leaflets which are bright green in color. The tree produces male flowers on catkins and female flowers on terminal clusters where the fruit develops. The fruit of the walnut tree is a fleshy green drupe in which the nut is encased. The kernel of the nut is protected by a corrugated woody shell. Walnut trees can reach 25–35 m (82–115 ft) in height and can live for periods in excess of 200 years. Walnut may also be referred to as Persian walnut, English walnut, common walnut or European walnut and originates from central Asia.

## Uses

Walnut kernels can be eaten fresh or processed for use in baked goods and confectionery. The timber of the tree is a highly valued as a wood for furniture making in Europe. Kernels may also be used as an animal feed or used to extract oil which was once a popular thinner for oil based paints.Basic requirements

Walnut can be grown successfully in a wide variety of climates but blossoms can be damaged by frost or high humidity. Must walnut varieties have a winter chilling requirement of 800–1000 hours below 7°C (45°F) to break dormancy and require a growing season of at least 200 frost-free days. Walnut trees should be planted in areas where there is good air circulation and drainage and will grow optimally when planted in a deep, fertile, well-draining loam soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. Walnut roots systems can be extensive and It is not unusual for walnut roots to grow to depths of 4.5 m (15 ft). Water-logged soils will limit root growth and should be avoided. Walnuts will usually begin to produce in the fourth or fifth year following planting.

## Propagation

Walnut trees are usually propagated vegetatively by budding or grafting, while saplings for rootstock are grown from seed. The planting site should be prepared by levelling the ground and eliminating weeds. Trees are planted by digging a hole that is twice as wide as the existing root ball. Aged manure or compost may be added to the soil at time of planting by incorporating it into the backfill soil. Trees should be spaced 10–15 m (33–50 ft) apart. In commercial plantations, trees may be spaced closer together. Grafted trees will begin to bear fruit in 5 years, while non-grafted plants may take 7-8 years. Newly planted young trees require staking as the new wood is soft and the tree can be damaged by winds.

General care and maintenance

Walnut trees should be trained to a central leader or modified leader system. Trees should be pruned in the Fall to prevent sap bleeding. Once the desired shape has been achieved, annual pruning should focus on thinning the tops of the trees to allow better air and light penetration to the canopy. In commercial orchards, lower limbs may be removed to facilitate the movement of machinery through the orchard. Newly planted walnut trees should be provided with supplemental irrigation for the first two years following planting. Trees should be watered deeply and the soil allowed to dry out between waterings. Irrigation is also required in the period after bloom in order to maximize nut production. In addition to an initial application of manure at planting, trees should be provided with 100–400 g of nitrogen per tree until the fifth year. In the sixth year, trees may be provided with up to 100 kg of nitrogen per hectare.

### Harvesting

Walnuts in the home garden can simply be collected when they drop from the tree. In commercial orchards, walnuts are commonly harvested with the used of a mechanical shaker. Once the nuts are collected, they must be immediately hulled (the process of removing the nut from the green flesh) and dried.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose Gnomonia leptostyla

- Symptoms: Brown to black lesions on leaves, petioles, shoots and/or husks which fade toward the center and may be surrounded by a chlorotic halo; spots may coalesce to form large necrotic patches, usually located close to leaf margins; lesions on shoots, petioles and leaf midribs become elongated and sunken

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease affects English walnut and is widespread in Europe; disease is also known to occur in the Pacific Northwest of the United States

- Management: Management Control of anthracnose in pistachio relies on the application of appropriate fungicide sprays; cultural practices can help to reduce the severity of the disease and include: removing leaf debris from around plants, avoiding wetting foliage when irrigating, spacing trees adequately to increase air circulation and applications of nitrogen fertilizer in Spring to delay leaf maturity and reduce the development of lesions

#### Armillaria root rot (Oak root fungus) Armillaria mellea

- Symptoms: Small, discolored leaves which drop early; death of branches; death of plant; clusters of honey-colored mushrooms may sprout at base of plant

- Cause: Fungus

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Bacteria overwinter in dormant buds; following bud break the following year, bacteria infect surrounding leaves and young fruit; emergence of walnut blight is favored by periods of wet weather

- Management: Management The primary method of controlling walnut blight is the application of copper containing bactericides such as Bordeaux mixture; bactericides should be applied weekly to protect new growth during periods of wet weather

### Disease Category: Oomycete

#### Phytophthora root and crown rot Phytophthora spp.

- Symptoms: Slow growing trees with reduced vigor; leaves of tree turning yellow and wilting; shoots and branches dying back; if tree is girdled at the trunk or root crown then death occurs, usually within one growing season; infected tree roots are necrotic and discolored black or brown; most roots eventually die; trees with crown rot may exhibit cankers of the root crown which extend above the soil line; cankers are visible as discolored bark and possess a zonate appearance when the bark is removed

- Cause: Oomycete

- Comments: Disease emergence favored by water saturated soils; disease is usually introduced to orchards through contaminated soil, water and plants

- Management: Management Control should focus on minimizing soil wetness and saturation by planting trees in well-draining soils; drainage can be improved by levelling soil or installing drainage systems; avoid wetting tree trunks when irrigating; ensure graft union is several centimeters above the soil line when planting trees


# Watermelon

## Description

Watermelon, Citrullus lanatus, is a vining annual plant in the family Cucurbitaceae grown for its fleshy fruit.  Watermelon vines are thin, grooved and covered in tiny hairs. Vines are branching and possess deeply lobed pinnate leaves. The plant produces solitary yellow flowers and and a large spherical to oblong fruit. The fruit is a 'pepo' - a fleshy fruit protected by a thick leathery rind. The fruit is smooth, light to dark green in color and can be striped, marbled or solid green. The flesh of the fruit is usually red in color but some cultivars produce green, orange or white flesh and contains numerous seeds which are usually black or dark brown in color. Watermelon vines can reach a length of 3 m (10 ft) and as an annual, survives only one growing season. Watermelon originates from Africa.

## Uses

Watermelon is usually consumed as a fresh fruit. In Africa it is sometimes cooked before eating and may also be used as an animal feed.Requirements

Watermelon is a warm-season crop, requiring lots of sun and good drainage to develop optimally and growing best at temperatures between 18 and 28°C (65–82°F). Watermelon will yield best if grown in a light, well-draining soil, rich in organic matter and with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Watermelon should be planted in  full sun and heavy feeders. They need to be provided with even soil moisture and fertilized regularly. Vining varieties can grow to very large sizes and require a good deal of space.

### Sowing seeds

Watermelon can be direct seeded in areas with a long, warm growing season but in more Northern climates it should be sown indoors and transplanted. If direct seeding,seeds should be sown after the last frosts and when the soil has warmed to at least 18.4°C (65°F). Allow 90–120 cm (~3–4 ft) between seeds in a row and 150–180 cm (~5–6 ft) between rows.  If transplanting, seeds should be sown approximately 3–4 weeks before the last frost date in your area and transplanted after the plants develop their first set of true leaves. Sow seeds in 3–4 in pots using a sterile seed starting mix and planting to a depth of 1–2 cm (~0.5 in). Thin seedlings once they are established. Seeds sown both indoors and out require lightly moist soil for germination, care should be taken to avoid overwatering as seeds are prone to rotting. Seeds should germinate in 3–10 days depending on the soil temperature.

### Transplanting

Watermelon seedlings should be transplanted when all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed to at least 18.4°C (65°F). Covering soil with dark plastic or mulch a week prior to planting outdoors can help bring the soil temperature up more quickly in colder regions, allowing earlier planting. Beginning approximately 7–10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https://www.plantvillage.com/posts/264). The planting site should be prepared by incorporating plenty of organic matter to encourage vegetative growth. When transplanting seedlings, allow 90–120 cm (~3–4 ft) between plants and 150–180 cm (~5–6 ft) between rows. Drip or soaker irrigation is preferred to overhead irrigation and plants should be watered evenly to keep them moist.

### General care

Watermelon vines are sprawling and require plenty space to grow. Vines can be trained to grow on a trellis or fence to save space. Watermelon plants Watermelons have a very deep root system which allows them to access soil moisture efficiently. However, if conditions are very dry for prolonged periods then additional water should be provided.. Plastic mulches are highly recommended in areas where conditions are not ideal for growth as they conserve soil moisture and black polyethylene has the advantage of warming the soil. Floating row covers can be beneficial while the plants establish to protect against insect pests.

### Harvesting

Watermelons are ready to be harvested when the the tendrils closest to the fruit are beginning to dry out and turn brown. The underside of the melon should be beginning to turn yellow

- Cause: Fungi

- Comments: Disease emergence favored by dry weather and high relative humidity

- Management: Management Plant in sites with good air circulation and sun exposure; do not overcrowd plants; sanitize equipment regularly

#### Verticillium wilt Verticillium dahliae

- Symptoms: Symptoms generally appear after fruit set; chlorotic leaves which develop necrotic areas; leaves collapsing; symptoms only on one side of vine; discoloration of vascular tissue in roots

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus can survive in soil for many years; disease emergence favored by cool or mild weather in Spring

- Management: Management Do not plant in areas where other susceptible crops have been grown previously; delay planting until temperatures are warmer

### Disease Category: Bacterial

#### Angular leaf spot Pseudomonas syringae

- Symptoms: Small water-soaked lesions on leaves which expand between leaf veins and become angular in shape; in humid conditions, lesions exude a milky substance which dries to form a white crust on or beside lesions; as the disease progresses, lesions turn tan and may have yellow/green edges; the centers of the lesions dry and may drop out leaving a hole in the leaf

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Spread through infected seed, splashing rain, insects and movement of people between plants; bacterium overwinters in crop debris and can survive for 2.5 years

- Management: Management Use disease-free seed; do not grow plants in field where cucurbits have been grown in the previous 2 years; protective copper spray may help reduce incidence of disease in warm, humid climates; plant resistant varieties

#### Bacterial fruit blotch Acidovorax avenae

- Symptoms: Small water-soaked lesions on top or sides of fruit which enlarge over surface; lesions on fruit may turn reddish or brown and crack

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Spread through infected seed or water splash; disease emergence favors wet conditions

- Management: Management Use pathogen-free seed and transplants; rotate crops; avoid the use of overhead irrigation

### Disease Category: Other

#### Aster yellows Aster yellows phytoplasma

- Symptoms: Foliage turning yellow; secondary shoots begin growing prolifically; stems take on a rigid, upright growth habit; leaves are often small in size and distorted, may appear thickened; flowers are often disfigured and possess conspicuous leafy bracts; fruits are small and pale in color

- Cause: Phytoplasma

- Comments: Disease is transmitted by leafhoppers and can cause huge losses in cucurbit crops

- Management: Management Remove any infected plants from the field to reduce spread; control weeds in and around the field that may act as a reservoir for the phytoplasma; protect plants from leaf hopper vectors with row covers

#### Blossom-end rot

- Symptoms: Symptoms first appear on immature fruits as small light brown spots close to the blossom end of the fruit; as fruit grow, the spots enlarge, resulting in dark leathery lesions sunken into the fruit

- Cause: Nutritional disorder

- Comments: Watermelon varieties that produce long fruit are more susceptible to blossom- end rot

- Management: Management Blossom-end rot is caused by a lack of calcium in the developing fruit and it occurs when the uptake of nutrients to the plant is disrupted; factors which disrupt nutrient uptake include drought, root damage or high soil salinity; application of excess nitrogen fertilizer may also contribute to the development of blossom-end rot as it promotes vigorous growth of vegetative tissues and depletion of calcium in the soil; watering plants evenly and regularly reduces the incidence of blossom-end rot

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Cucumber green mottle mosaic Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV)

- Symptoms: Early symptoms on young plants include vein-clearing and the development of crumpled leaves; older plants develop bleached and/or chlorotic leaves. As the infection progresses, leaves develop mottling and become blistered and distorted. Leaf symptoms are very difficult to distinguish from other mosaic viruses of Cucurbits/ Severity of symptoms varies depending on the strain of the virus.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: All Cucurbit species are susceptible to the virus, some cucumber varieties have been developed which have some resistance to the disease and are available in Canada and Europe.

- Management: Management As the virus is spread primarily by infected seed, only disease- free seed from a reputable supplier should be planted. Seedlings and plants infected with the virus should be removed and destroyed to prevent spread. All seedlings/plants within a 3-5 ft radius of the infected plant should also be destroyed. The virus can be spread mechanically via tools and on hands, good sanitation should be practiced at all times to prevent virus transmission - disinfect all tools and equipment between uses by dipping in a solution of bleach or using a commercially available disinfectant such as Virkon.

#### Cucumber mosaic Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)

- Symptoms: Plants may e severely stunted; foliage is covered in distinctive yellow mosaic; leaves of plant curl downwards and leaf size is smaller than normal; flowers on infected plants may be deformed with green petals; fruits become distorted and are small in size; fruit is often discolored

- Cause: Viruses

- Comments: Transmitted by aphids; virus has an extensive host range; can be mechanically transmitted via tools etc.

- Management: Management Control of the virus is largely dependant on the control of the aphid vectors; reflective mulches can deter aphid feeding; aphid outbreaks can be treated with mineral oils or insecticidal soap applications; some resistant varieties are available

#### Watermelon mosaic Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV)

- Symptoms: Symptoms vary widely depending on species, cultivar, virus strain and environmental conditions; symptoms on leaves may include green mosaic patternation, green vein-banding, chlorotic rings and disfigured leaves

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Virus is found in almost all Cucurbit growing regions in the world; virus is spread by over 20 aphid species

- Management: Management Treatments that control populations of aphid vectors can also reduce the incidence of the virus; spraying plants with mineral oils or insecticidal soaps can help to reduce aphid numbers

#### Zucchini yellow mosaic Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV)

- Symptoms: Infected plants are severely stunted and leaves can exhibit a variety of symptoms including yellow mosaic patternation, severe deformation, blistering, reduced size and necrosis; fruits are deformed

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: DIsease can cause devastating epidemics when present

- Management: Management Use of resistant varieties, where available, is usually the most effective method of controlling the virus; control of aphid populations on the plants can be achieved through the use of mineral oils and insecticidal soaps but is rarely effective at controlling the virus


# Wheat

## Description

Wheat, is the name given to several plants in the genus Triticum including Triticum aestivum, Triticum compactum, Triticum spelta and Triticum durum, which are annual or biennial grasses grown primarily for their grain. Wheat species possess an erect smooth stem with linear leaves that grow in two rows on either side of the stem with larger 'flag' leaves at the top of the stem. The stem terminates in a spike that is made up on individual spikelets, each possessing 3–9 florets. The wheat fruit develops within the spikelets, maturing to a seed (kernel). Wheat can reach 1.2 m (4 ft) in height and like other cereals, has been developed into different varieties that are adapted to planting at different times of the year. Spring wheat is planted for a late summer harvest, whereas Winter wheat is planted for harvesting in early to mid summer. Overwintering varieties are more commonly grown in regions with mild winters. Wheat may be referred to by variety and these include durum or macaroni wheat (Triticum durum), club wheat (Triticum compactum), spelt wheat (Triticum spelta) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Wheat originated in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East.

## Uses

Wheat is one of the most important food plants in the world. It is used primarily to produce flour for bread. It is used widely in the production of many other baked goods. Wheat grain is also used in the manufacture of alcoholic beverages and alcohol. Wheat straw is used as an animal feed and in the manufacture of carpets, baskets, packing, bedding, and paper.Wheat varieties One of the first things to consider before planting is which type of wheat you want to grow. There are several different varieties to choose from depending on the time of year and how you want to utilize your harvest. Wheat is broadly categorized into Winter wheat and Spring wheat. Winter wheat is high yielding and is planted in the Fall and harvested in the Spring or Summer of the following year (depending on location). Spring wheat is not as high yielding but tolerated drier conditions. It is planted in the Spring and harvested in the Fall. Both Spring and Winter wheat is then further categorized as soft wheat, hard wheat, spelt or durum.

General requirements Wheat can be grown in a wide variety of climates but grows best in cool regions where the temperature is between 10 and 24°C (50–75°F). Wheat will not grow at temperatures above 35°C (95°F). Wheat will grow optimally in a deep, fertile, well draining and well aerated soil at a pH between 5.5 and 7.5.

Planting Winter wheat varieties should be planted in the Fall approximately 6 to 8 weeks before the first frost date. Spring wheat varieties should be planted as soon as the soil can be worked in the Spring. Commercially grown wheat is usually mechanically drilled using a machine that creates a furrow and drops the seed in before covering it back up. Wheat seeds can be sown by hand broadcasting in smaller areas, or using a hand-cranked seeder. Seeds are usually sown to at depths ranging from 2 to 12 cm (0.8–4.7 in) depending on soil conditions (seed must be sown deeper in drier soil). Once the seeds have been scattered, the soil should be raked lightly to set the seeds at the desired depth.

Harvesting Wheat is ready to harvest when the stalks and heads have turned from green to yellow and the seed heads are drooping towards the ground. Check the seeds for ripeness before harvest. The should be firm and crunchy and not doughy in texture. Commercially produced wheat is usually harvested using a combine. Smaller plots can be harvested by hand using a scythe or sickle. Small plots can be harvested by snipping off the heads with a pair of scissors.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Other

#### Altenaria triticina (leaf blight)

- Symptoms:

- Cause:

#### Bacterial leaf streak and black chaff Xanthomonas campestris

- Symptoms: Sudden appearance of water-soaked, light brown, elongated lesions on upper leaves; lesions quickly dry out and turn into necrotic streaks on the leaves; black stripes occur on glumes and purple black lesions appear on rachis and peduncle if infection is in the head

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease spread through infected seed and splashing water

- Management: Management Avoid planting seed from infected fields; avoid overhead irrigation; plant less susceptible cultivars

#### Basal glume rot Pseudomonas syringae

- Symptoms: Dull brown to black discoloration of glumes which is more pronounced on the inner side; seeds may be shriveled; if infection is severe, entire glume may be discolored; small water-soaked lesions may form on leaves

- Cause: Bacterium

- Comments: Disease spreads primarily through infected seed

- Management: Management Avoid planting seed from plants grown in fields where the disease is known to be present

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Barley yellow dwarf Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV)

- Symptoms: Yellowing leaves, particularly the flag leaves; stunted plants due to shortened internodes; leaves may be red, purpple, orange, green or brown; leaves may be distorted

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: Transmitted by a few species of aphid; spread of disease is completely dependent on the movement of aphid vectors

- Management: Management Control of aphid population can provide some control of disease but is dependent on knowing which aphids are active in the field; planting to avoid periods of peak aphid activity can provide a measure of control

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Common bunt (Stinking smut) Tilletia tritici

- Symptoms: Slender heads which take longer to turn color than healthy heads; glumes spread apart to reveal spori or "bunt balls" (balls containing fungal spores) which are a similar size to normal kernel but are gray-brown in color; bunt balls break open on harvest and give off a fishy odor

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease is most commonly introduced through infected seed although spores are spread by wind

- Management: Management Disease can be controlled by planting resistant wheat varieties, planting disease-free seed and using a seed treatment prior to planting; disease may also be avoided by planting wheat early in the Fall and by shallow seeding

#### Ergot disease Claviceps purpurea

- Symptoms: Main symptoms of ergot is the grains in the head are replaced by dark purple to black sclerotia. This ergot bodies were made up of vegetative strands of fungus. The sclerotic interior is white or tennis white in color. The size of grain kernel and ergot are similar in size. The initial symptom before sclerotia bodies is honey dew symptom occur during flowering stage. The fungus produce yellowish, sugary excretions and can see as droplets on flower parts.

- Cause: Fungal

- Comments: Ergot is toxic to animals including birds.

- Management: Management Follow crop rotation with non host crops for one year. Deep summer ploughing kills sclerotia bodies present in soil. Keep the field free from grasses and other weeds. Use disease free seeds.

#### Eyespot Oculimacula spp.

- Symptoms: Elliptical lesions that first appear on leaf sheath and gradually spread to stem; lesions are yellow-brown to tan in color and occur length-ways down the stem; lesions can occur individually or groups of lesions can coalesce to form large areas of discoloration; lesions may eventually girdle the stem; a gray, thread-like fungal growth may occur on the stem beneath the lesion; mature stems may have a charred appearance; infected tillers mature early and develop white heads and poorly filled seed; tillers may fall if stems are severely infected

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Primary route of infection is by splashing water; emergence of disease favored by high soil moisture content and a dense crop canopy

- Management: Management Rotation of crop away from cereals for a period of 2-3 years will reduce levels of inoculum in the field; fungicides are commonly applied close to stem elongation to control the disease; plant resistant wheat varieties if available in your area

#### Fusarium head blight (Scab) Fusarium spp.

- Symptoms: One or more spikelets on newly emerged head bleached; pink or orange fungal masses may be visible at the base of infected spikelet; infected spikelets do not produce seed or produce shriveled and/or discolored seed; severe infections can cause the kernels to have a chalky appearance and are frequently lost during harvest

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Fungus survives between seasons on host plant debris - other host include corn and barley; fungus can survive on host debris for several years; warm, moist conditions promote the spread of the disease when present

- Management: Management Control of the disease can be difficult; durum wheat appears to be more susceptible to the disease than common wheat; crop rotation to a non-host is recommended for at least one year; applications of appropriate fungicides if available can help to control the disease in conjunction with the other measures detailed here

#### Phythium root rot Phythium sp.

- Symptoms: The infected plants become chlorotic and/ stunted. Often the symptom is confused with nitrogen deficiency. And the plants may produce shriveled grain. Even a mild infection reduce tillers, plant population and maturity. Since symptom appear through out the field make if difficult to diagnose the disease.

- Cause: Fungal

- Comments: Fungus live for years in soil and on old root debris.

- Management: Management Use good quality seeds. Provide supplemental phosphorous. Sowing when soil temperature is about 50 F increase germination and establishment. Seed treatment with suitable fungicides.

#### Powdery mildew Erysiphe graminis

- Symptoms: Patches of cottony, white-gray growth on upper surface of leaves which turn gray-brown; chlorotic patches develop on leaves opposite fungal growth; fungal fruiting bodies usually become visible as black dots on the mildew

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors heavy nitrogen fertilization; high humidity and cool temperatures

- Management: Management Planting resistant wheat varieties is one of the best ways to protect plants from powdery mildew; other control strategies include: application of appropriate foliar fungicides, if available; removal of crop debris from field after harvest to reduce the level of overwintering fungus; removal of volunteer wheat plants which can act as a reservoir for the disease

#### Rusts Stem rust ( Puccinia graminis ) Leaf rust ( P. triticina ) Stripe rust (P. striiformis)

- Symptoms: Chlorotic flecks or brown necrotic spots on leaves or stems; yellow streaks or patches on foliage; brown necrotic streaks on foliage; raised orange pustules may be present on lesions

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease emergence favors cool, wet conditions

- Management: Management The most effective method of controlling rusts is to plant resistant varieties of wheat; other methods of control include: destroying alternate hosts; applications of appropriate protective fungicides; growing wheat varieties that mature early

#### Tan spot Pyrenophora tritici-repentis

- Symptoms: Oval or diamond shaped necrotic lesions with brown centers and yellow halos on leaves

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease infection requires a wet period of between 6 and 48 days

- Management: Management Disease can be significantly reduced by rotating crops with non- hosts and tilling crop debris into soil after harvest

# Yams

## Description

Yam is the name given to several plant species in the genus Dioscorea including Dioscorea alata (white yam), Dioscorea bulbifera (potato yam), Dioscorea cayenensis (yellow yam),  Dioscorea esculenta (Asiatic yam) and Dioscorea batatas (Chinese yam) that are grown for their edible tubers. These species are not to be confused with the sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas, which is often referred to as a yam in the US. Yam plants are herbaceous annual or perennials with climbing or trailing vines. The vines can be smooth or prickly, reaching 10 m (32.8 ft) or more in length depending on the variety. The leaves of the plant are simple and usually oval to heart-shaped with petioles which are the same length, or slightly longer, than the leaf blade itself. Some varieties possess spikes at the bases of the leaves. The plant can produce one singular tuber or several tubers which extend from stolons from a central corm (up to 20) depending on the species. The tubers can be cylindrical, curved or lobed, with brown, grey, black or pink skin and white, orange or purplish flesh. Most yams are annual plants, harvested after one season, but some are perennial with tubers increasing in size each year with the vines dying back at the end of the growing season and regrowing on the return of favorable conditions. The origin of yams is uncertain and genetic information suggests that there may be more than one point of origin.

## Uses

Yams are used differently in different parts of the world. They are consumed after cooking by frying, boiling or roasting. The green parts of some plants can be cooked and consumed as a vegetable. Yams may also be used  to produce flour or starch.Basic requirements

Yams are mainly grown in tropical and subtropical climates and they do not grow well at temperatures below 22°C (71.6°F) and are killed by frost.. The optimum temperature for the growth of yams is between 25 and 30°C (77–86°F). They grow optimally in well-draining fertile soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5 in full sun or part shade. Very wet soils should be avoided as this promotes tuber rot.

## Propagation

Yams are propagated vegetatively from small tubers. Land should be prepared for planting by plowing and harrowing.  Tubers should be planted in trenches to a depth of 15 cm (6 in) allowing at least 30 cm (12 in) between individual plants and 1.5 m (5 ft) between rows. The soil is often mounded around plants or ridged to aid drainage. It is common practice to stake plants with a 2–4 m (6.6–13.2 ft) support to allow them to climb and ensure that all parts of the plant receive adequate sunlight.

General care and maintenance

Yams require 100 cm of water distributed evenly throughout the growing season. Yam plants should be mulched after planting to prevent plants from drying out. Failure to mulch the plants will result in drastic decreases in yield.

### Harvesting

Yams can be harvested at any time after the leaves have started to yellow. The soil should be carefully dug around the tuber and the the tuber cut from the vine. Harvesting is best carried out on sunny, dry days to prevent tuber rot.

## Common Pests and Diseases

## Diseases

### Disease Category: Fungal

#### Anthracnose (Scorch) Colletotrichum gleosporoides

- Symptoms: Small, dark brown spots or black lesions on leaves which may be surrounded by a chlorotic halo; leaf necrosis; dieback of stem; withered leaves and scorched appearance

- Cause: Fungus

- Comments: Disease overwinters in plant debris; occurs worldwide

- Management: Management The most effective method of controlling the disease is to plant yam varieties that are resistant to anthracnose such as TDA 291 or TDA 297

### Disease Category: Viral

#### Yam mosaic disease Yam mosaic potyvirus

- Symptoms: The common symptoms are infected leaves show yellow and green patterns (called mosaics) between the veins or may show a narrow green strips bordering the veins (called vein banding). If the disease is severe the leaves become long, thin and strap shape (called shoe-string symptom) and whole plant become stunted. Plant may produce few small tubers with less starch content. Some plants may recover from the virus infection soon after first symptom but virus may survive in plant and reduce the vigour.

- Cause: Virus

- Comments: The virus is transmitted by aphids and tubers/setts. It may cause up to 40% loss in yield. Yam mosaic virus is always associated with yam mild mosaic virus, yam badnaviruses and cucumber mosaic virus in Africa making this disease more complex. Disease is reported in West Africa , South America and Caribbean.

- Management: Management Use healthy and disease free tubers or setts for planting. Select healthy and large tubers for planting instead of small tubers. Keep fields free from weeds. Collect crop debris and destroy them.
